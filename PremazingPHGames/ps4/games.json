Its architecture consists of a mixture of various ancient cultures, such as Greek, Egyptian or Maya.

The game focuses on the obscure battles of the war. It features storylines that tie the battles together and consist of episodes called “war stories”.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nBattlefield V puts a strong emphasis on realism. The game avoids video game abstractions in favor of immersive experience of the war. For that goal, the game aims to increase the player's interaction with the environment, such as doors, vehicles, or ammo. The ammo and other resources in the game are scarce, forcing the player to use a tactical approach.\r\nThe game gives a spotlight to women in the military who are among the main characters in the campaign. The player might also choose to play a female character in the multiplayer, as the gender is not tied to a class. The game also allows the players many customization options for costumes, vehicles, and weapons.\r\n\r\n###Modes\r\nBattlefield V has many multiplayer modes, some of which are new to the series and some are reimagined versions of the modes from previous games. For example, The Grand Operations mode is based on the original Battlefield mode called Operations. This mode imitates a military campaign and consists of a series of battles with different objectives and non-linear progress options.", "publisher": "Electronic Arts", "developer": "Electronic Arts",

An Edge Guard system ensures that the protagonist cannot fall from most platforms. At the few selected locations, the protagonist can fall to her death and respawn.\n\n###Style\nBound features a notably colorful and surreal visual style.

Carmageddon: Max Damage features a wide and varied range of cool, crazy, custom killing machines; each with its own highly distinctive “character”. Carmageddon cars are specifically built for the job in hand – wrecking opponents and killing peds! Nearly 20 years ago the original Carmageddon invented the whole concept of videogame physics and real-time damaging of cars and scenery, and so it’s obviously been our responsibility to bring this technology BANG up-to-date with a brand new state of the art car damage (and repair) system. Crush, bend, twist, and completely mangle your opponents’ and your own car – smash parts off, or split it in two; the original game was all about wrecking motors and pummelling pedestrians, and today we take this to a whole new level!  Power, Armour, and Offensive upgrades are available for your car, along with other customising options, allowing you to personalise the killing capabilities of your rides.\nA host of old favourites from the original Carmageddon make a comeback, along with some all-new faces. Only ever seen before as low resolution mugshots, now you get to see them from head to toe (well, head to knees in the case of Screwie) in full HD 3D glory – usually as they smash through their windscreen and hurtle past (or INTO) yours!\nThe new environments are amalgamations of the best bits from the numerous chunks of landscape that we all loved to tear around in Carmageddon. “Bleak City”, \"Devil's Canyon\", “Dusty Trails”, “MagNuChem” and \"Snowy\" levels all return in updated forms, with their memorable landmark features such as the Loop ’de’ Loop, acid pits and Football Stadium. Everything is reassuringly surreal; hell, we’ve even managed to incorporate a giant food mixer into a level!\nThe topography and detail in the locations is updated and enhanced, with even more fun stuff to smash into, smash up, snap off, and send careening into the poor pedestrian population. “Nice Shot Sir!” And talking of pedestrians…\nOnce again, the game features a varied mix of adult pedestrians of all ages, shapes, persuasions and species. Classic pedestrians are back, such as old lady on a Zimmer frame and old man with his stick, with their famous cry “I was in the war!”, plus bikini babes and swimming trunk hunks, fat bastards, and herds of cows in improbable locations. Joining them are some new faces – including cyclists, wheelchair users and peds on mobility scooters. Carmageddon is an equal opportunities ped slaughterfest!\nPowerUps are back and this time they’re even funnier, surrealier, hurtier, and messier than ever! Lots of the classic PUps return in super-enhanced form, such as Repulsificators, Kangaroos & Solid Granites. Then we have all new PUps like \"Pelvic Thrust\" and a variety under the heading “Tossers”! Combine PUps to create hilarious combo results like Groovin’ Helium Filled Peds, or Peds without legs at a Temporary Rapture!\nLeaderboards. Challenge yourself to reach the top of the leaderboard using skill or brute force!\nAchievements. A suitably warped array of mad Feats and Exploits will garner you the rewards that every gamer dreams of.\nChallenges: Do the most stupid things, collect meaningless trinkets and waste hours of your life in the pursuit of ultimately pointless goals!\nSmelly Bushes: We’ve hidden a variety of these specially fragrant Easter Eggs throughout the game to keep you busy and entertained!\nCarMODgeddon: The whole game is MODdable for your MODding pleasure!\nCheck out the official Carmageddon comic series!

Your Stage allows experienced rally players to create longer, more technical routes, whilst newcomers can create simpler shorter routes as they hone their skills.\nWith DiRT 4, Codemasters have sought to bring the levels of thrill from last year’s DiRT Rally with the fearless excitement, accessibility and adrenaline-fueled races previously seen in its critically acclaimed prequels DiRT 2 and DiRT 3.\nFeaturing classic rally racing that continues to build on the foundations set by the Colin McRae Rally games, the bruising contests from the official FIA World Rallycross Championship, the crazy battles of racing trucks and buggies, and the outrageous fun of open events in Joyride, players will face challenges from locations that span three continents.\n• OVER 50 OF THE MOST BREATH-TAKING OFF-ROAD CARS EVER BUILT – Including Ford Fiesta R5, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI, Subaru WRX STI NR4 and Audi Sport quattro S1 E2\n• 5 INCREDIBLE RALLY LOCATIONS WITH MILLIONS OF ROUTES – Australia, Spain, Michigan, Sweden & Wales\n• THE OFFICIAL GAME OF THE FIA WORLD RALLYCROSS CHAMPIONSHIP – Race at Montalegre, Lohéac Bretagne, Hell, Holjes & Lydden Hill in a multitude of different series\n• LANDRUSH – Short-course dirt track racing in Pro Buggies, Pro-2 Trucks, Pro-4 Trucks and Crosskart vehicles in California, Nevada and Mexico\n• JOYRIDE - Laptime challenges, smash challenges, free-play area and send challenges to friends\n• DiRT ACADEMY – Taking place at the DirtFish Rally School in Washington, USA, learn the skills, techniques and practice to become the best!\n• CAREER MODE – create your driver, compete across the disciplines, gain sponsors and build your team with clear goals and rewards\n• COMPETITIVE GAMING – Daily, weekly and month-long challenges against fellow players from around the world\n• NEXT GENERATION OF RACENET – Live ladder, leagues and tournaments, cross-platform leaderboards, enhanced CREST telemetry system\n• TUNING – Tweak your set-up based on vehicle, track and weather conditions to best suit your racing style\n• DAMAGE & REPAIRS – Wear and tear is faithfully recreated with an improved and realistic damage model.

The creatures evolve during the hunt, making them a difficult prey. The game also allows the players to control the monsters.\n\n###Plot\nEvolve takes place in a distant future on a faraway planet called Shear. Humans only recently colonized the planet and encountered hostile alien monsters that quickly evolve. As they consume other local animals, they can mutate into new, stronger creatures. The main protagonist in the story mode is William Cabot, a retired famous monster hunter, who comes to Shear to \"tame\" the planet and save the colonists from the monsters.\n\n###Gameplay\nWhile the game has a single player campaign, it is oriented towards online multiplayer team deathmatches. The teams are asymmetrical: a group of four hunters opposes one monster. The hunters have to find and annihilate the monsters using their guns, jetpacks, and tracking devices. The monster's goal is to evolve. It requires him or her to prey on the smaller animals to gather experience and level up. Until the monster reaches its full power, it is very vulnerable.\n\n###Character classes\nBoth factions have several classes. The hunters have five characters in each of their four classes: Assault, Trapper, Support, and Medic. The monsters have five types: Goliath, Kraken, Wraith, Behemoth, and Gorgon. Both monsters and hunters only start with the basic characters and have to unlock the rest by defeating the enemies.", "publisher": "2K Games", "developer": "2K", "releaseDate": 20150210, "screenshots": ["screenshots/EVOLVE.jpg"], "score": 76}, {"name": "f1 2021", "size": "76.87 GiB", "fileCount": "2", "date": "20220322", "files": ["EP4001-CUSA26238_00-F12021PS4EMASTER_CUSA26238_1.00_Game.pkg", "EP4001-CUSA26238_00-F12021PS4EMASTER_CUSA26238_1.14_Patch.pkg"], "iconUrl": "covers/f1 2021.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/f1 2021.jpg", "matchedName": "F1 2021", "category": ["Racing", "Simulation", "Sports"], "description": "• The entire F1® 2021 game\n• Braking Point Content Pack\n• Celebrate the release of F1® 2021 with exclusive in-game items inspired by the fictional stars of the new ‘Braking Point’ story experience.

The plot shifts when the player learns that Brahne is a pawn of a more menacing threat, Kuja, who shares a mysterious history with Zidane spanning two worlds.\nThe game was developed alongside Final Fantasy VIII. Envisioned by developers as a retrospective for the series, it departed from the futuristic settings of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII by returning to the medieval style of the first six installments. Consequently, it was influenced heavily by the original Final Fantasy game, and features allusions to the rest of the titles. Despite this approach, the game did introduce new features to the series, such as \"Active Time Event\" cutscenes, \"Mognet\", and unique equipment and skill systems.\nFinal Fantasy IX was released to critical acclaim. It is often cited by critics and fans as one of the best Final Fantasy titles, and holds the highest Metacritic score of the series. Final Fantasy IX was commercially successful, selling more than 5 million copies worldwide by March 2003 and 5.5 million copies by February 2016. It was re-released in 2010 as a PSOne Classic on the PlayStation Store; this version was compatible with PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation Vita support arrived in 2012. In 2016, ports featuring minor gameplay and graphical enhancements were released for iOS, Android and Microsoft Windows followed by a port for PlayStation 4 in 2017.", "publisher": "Electronic Arts", "developer": "Square Enix", "releaseDate": 20000707, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Final Fantasy IX.jpg"], "score": 84}, {"name": "Final Fantasy VII Remake", "size": "80.03 GiB", "fileCount": "7", "date": "20220303", "files": ["UP0082-CUSA07211_00-ACC9001000000000_CUSA07211__Addon.pkg", "UP0082-CUSA07211_00-ACC9002000000000_CUSA07211__Addon.pkg", "UP0082-CUSA07211_00-ARMOR90010000000_CUSA07211__Addon.pkg", "UP0082-CUSA07211_00-ARMOR90020000000_CUSA07211__Addon.pkg", "UP0082-CUSA07211_00-ARMOR90030000000_CUSA07211__Addon.pkg", "UP0082-CUSA07211_00-FFVIIDLXUPGRADE0_CUSA07211__Addon.pkg", "UP0082-CUSA07211_00-FFVIIREMAKE00000_CUSA07211_1.00_Game.pkg"], "iconUrl": "covers/Final Fantasy VII Remake.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Final Fantasy VII Remake.jpg", "matchedName": "Final Fantasy VII", "category": ["Adventure", "Action", "RPG"], "description": "The world is under the control of Shinra, a corporation controlling the planet's life force as mako energy.

Taking a unique and meta approach towards the Gundam universe, Gundam Breaker 3 continues the formula of bringing about action-packed mecha on mecha battles that revolve around one of the core aspects of the series: Gunpla aka Gundam Model Kits! For those new to this specific spin-off, the core mechanics revolve around the creative choice of building your own Gundam based on the many real life parts featured in the game; the previous title, Gundam Breaker 2, included over 100 Gunpla kits to choose form, which massively increased the number of options and customizations available to a total of over 10,000,000,000 different options! Customization is a big part of the Gundam Breaker series and the upcoming release will channel that mindset by allowing players more to choose from when it comes to Gunpla colors, as well as the plating coating and dirtiness, and the expression of damage. In addition to missile pods, rail cannons, beam launchers, and other weapons, there is expansion equipment with various abilities that can be equipped. This will allow players to create a Full Armor Mobile Suit of their own! The SD (Super Deformed) series of Gundam will now also be available in support roles, who will take instructions from the player during battles. SD Gundams can only be set to \"Module,\" the effects of which will extend to the full team. A new \"Bounty Hunter Mode\" has been added to the series.

Her world now in chaos, Ajna sets out on a quest to save everything she knows from being destroyed.\r\nKey Features:\r\nMasterfully crafted story and characters: Indivisible tells the story of Ajna, and her quest to find redemption for her father and village. Throughout her quest, she’ll encounter an incredibly diverse cast of “Incarnations”, people whom she can absorb into herself and manifest to fight alongside her. There are many Incarnations to recruit, and by uniting unique characters from faraway lands, she will learn about herself and the world she inhabits.\r\nAction-packed battles: Obtain a variety of weapon types, learn new combat skills and recruit more than 25 playable Incarnations to build your battle party and engage monsters in fast-paced, strategic combat.\r\nBeautifully drawn characters and world: Building on its winning formula of 2D, hand-drawn animation with Skullgirls, LabZero draws inspiration from various cultures and mythologies to create visually dynamic environments and a rich cast of characters with unique stories of their own.\r\nUnique Battle System: The key to success is mastering your party’s attacks to create combos, and experimenting with new Incarnations and attacks to make the most out of every round. The active controls allow your party to function as a single, customizable fighting game character while switching between characters and unlocking new attacks as Ajna’s affinity for her weapons develops.\r\nBuild your Inner Realm: Along with her ability to absorb certain people, Ajna will also discover she can meditate and enter a mysterious dimension growing inside her. Once she discovers it, Ajna’s Inner Realm becomes the central hub for the game, where most of the game’s quests, upgrade and saving functionality resides. Simply pressing a button will send Ajna to this realm, sparing needless trekking back to towns.\r\nStellar soundtrack: Lose yourself in a stunning soundtrack by legendary Japanese game music composer Hiroki Kikuta who is responsible for is responsible for the amazing soundtracks to Secret of Mana, Seiken Densetsu III (Secret of Mana 2), Soukaigi, and Koudelka among others.", "publisher": "505 Games", "developer": "Lab Zero Games", "releaseDate": 20191007, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Indivisible.jpg"], "score": 79}, {"name": "Infamous First Light", "size": "11.06 GiB", "fileCount": "3", "date": "20251107", "files": ["UP9000-CUSA00575_00-FIRSTLIGHTSHIP00_CUSA00575_1.00_Game.pkg", "UP9000-CUSA00575_00-FIRSTLIGHTSHIP00_CUSA00575_1.04_Patch.pkg", "UP9000-CUSA00575_00-UNLOCKCOSTUME000_CUSA00575__Addon.pkg"], "iconUrl": "covers/Infamous First Light.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Infamous First Light.jpg", "matchedName": "inFAMOUS: First Light", "category": ["Action"], "description": "InFAMOUS First Light is a third-person open-world game developed by Sucker Punch.

The device was banned for being too dangerous for robots.

The game was developed by the Japanese studio Team Ninja for the Sony PlayStation 4 console and PC in 2017. The development team previously released projects such as Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive. The version of the game for the PC contains all the additional content that came out on the console.\n\n###The setting\nThe game takes place in the seventeenth century Japan, in the fictionalized version of the Sengoku period, when the country was engulfed in the flames of civil war. The player takes control of the An Anglo-Irish sailor named William, who sets out in pursuit of the villain in the country of the rising sun and finds himself entangled in the mystical and political upheavals that pervaded all of Japan. Despite the fantasy elements, the plot uses real prototypes of historical events and personalities.\n\n###Key features\nThe controls are quite simple: two types of attack, block and dodge are available.

The story follows the survivors of a zombie virus outbreak in the fictional Raccoon City. There are two protagonists: Claire Redfield, a high school student, and Leon Kennedy, a policeman. They both search for the ways to escape the infested city. Companions, such as Ada Wong and Sherry, occasionally follow the protagonists. The characters eventually uncover the dark secrets of the Umbrella Corporation, which created the virus as a biological weapon, and fight its monsters, such as the Tyrant.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player controls either Leon or Claire from the third person view in a 3D environment. The two protagonists' storylines are intertwined. The player can complete the scenario playing one of the protagonists, and then replay it from the other character's POV, with all his previous actions taken into account. The game combines puzzle solving with zombie fights. Both protagonists use firearms as their main weapon; however, ammo is scarce.\n\n###Changes from the original\nBesides the updated graphics, the remake features a new camera and controls. In the original game, the controls were relative to the position of the player's character rather than the camera.

The levels rotate when the airship moves right or left and scroll when you fly up or down. Each level ends with a boss fight. \nEliminating enemies is the main objective in Resogun, but there’s also an optional objective to save the prisoners from their cages. Rescuing humans earns the player additional points, which is essential to set the high score. There are three modes: the Arcade mode, in which you simply pass through the consecutive levels; the Single Level mode, in which your goal is to obtain the highest score on a certain level; and a cooperative multiplayer for two.

Player discretion is advised.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The game focuses on exploration and builds tension slowly to create a deeper and more meaningful experience. Its story is unveiled through surreal imaging and subtle environment details. Be mindful that it is a difficult game in unconventional ways.\nVisage is a first-person psychological horror game.\nExplore a mysterious ever-changing house in a slow-paced, atmospheric world that combines both uncannily comforting and horrifyingly realistic environments, and enjoy a genuinely terrifying experience.EnvironmentThe game is set inside a huge house in which terrible things have happened. You’ll wander through the gloomy corridors, explore every dead room, and get lost in endless mazes, your head filling with memories of the dead families that once lived in this very home. This twisted environment, void of any life other than yours, takes you to places you couldn't even bear imagining.\nStorylineThis house is stained with a terrible past. Families were brutally murdered by their own family members, people went insane, many committed suicide, and other grisly events occurred. Each and every room has its story painted on an invisible canvas. As a player, you will relive parts of this dark past, and each of its fragments will leave you restless and terrified. You’ll soon wish you could join the dead's ranks in their abyss, but death won't help you leave this place. Will you run from it, or will you try to uncover the truth behind the shadows?\nDark entitiesThe families that died in the house will haunt you and leave you restless. They’ll follow your every move, watch you from every corner, play tricks with your mind, and try to attack you. Why do they haunt you? What have you done? This you have to find out on your own.\nGameplayIn Visage, you are defenseless; no weapons could save you from the dreadful entities stalking you from the next corner, the next door, or underneath your feet. You’ll be able to pick up key elements, interact with the environment, and search for things that may help you escape this nightmare or pull you deeper into it.\nDying is part of the game. You need to avoid terror at all costs, as dark entities are attracted to it. Maintaining your mind as sane as possible will keep you from joining the ranks of the dead.

A knight from the Grand Bell, Croix, is sent there to deal with the epidemic. The people of Metafalss, lead by the Grand Bell, rebel against the Goddess who controls the world, in order to achieve their dream and create a utopia by singing a Song in the Hymnos language, called Metafalica - as the legend says.\n\nMelody of Metafalica is an RPG, much like its predecessor, Melody of Elemia, that takes place one and a half years later. It is the second installment in the Ar tonelico series. The turn-based battle sequences from the random enemy encounters are split up into two phases. In the first one, Attack, the different characters can perform various attacks until a time gauge runs out. When there is a Reyvateil in the party, a member of the race who can wield magic by transforming sounds into energy, players can determine which magic to use and the moment to unleash it. In the second phase, Defend, enemies have the opportunity to attack and will target the (up to two) Reyvateil who are singing at the back of the party. The other characters must then defend by timing the defensive moves. The effectiveness of attacks is also often determined by how well the attacks are synced to the requests of the Reyvateil.\n\nThe game is largely centered around female heroines and it contains a dive system where Croix can dive into the mind (Cosmospheres) of certain Reyvateils to get to know their feelings and emotions. That game element plays out with text-heavy dating-style elements where the choices can alter the storyline and it is also the system through which new Song Magic is crafted. Diving can only be done to the three main characters in the game and Croix needs to commit to one, it is not possible to hop between them. New \"evil\" Reyvateil can be converted by using the Dive system and afterwards they will contribute to the party. These are equipped through an additional item slot that affects a character through offensive or defensive means.", "publisher": "NIS America", "developer": "Gust", "releaseDate": 20090120, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Ar Tonelico 2 - Melody of Metafalica.jpg"], "score": 71}, {"name": "Ar Tonelico", "filename": "Ar Tonelico.iso", "size": "2.93 GiB", "date": "20190130", "iconUrl": "covers/Ar Tonelico.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Ar Tonelico.jpg", "matchedName": "Ar Tonelico: Melody of Elemia", "category": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "description": "The story of Ar tonelico: Melody of Elemia takes place in the world of Sol Ciel, a world consisting of two floating islands connected by the Tower of Ar tonelico. Long ago people had built up a great civilization under the guidance of the goddesses the Trio of Elemia, but over the years things have changed; there were two disasters that have lead towards the destruction of the world. In the first disaster most of the lands and skies were lost, in the second the super civilization was lost; now in the third era another disaster is beginning. Viruses born in the Altar of Apostles have begun to appear, though normally not in physical form have now taken on the form of monsters and could destroy the world. In the upper levels of the Tower is a city called Platina where the Knights of Elemia reside; their job is to control virus outbreaks to preserve the tower. One such knight is Lyner Barsett; the main character of the story, he will need to go on a quest to find the Hymn Crystal which can save the Tower of Ar tonelico and the whole world.\n\nAr tonelico: Melody of Elemia is an RPG style game where you control Lyner Barsett. As the game begins, your airship crashes in the lower world; you'll not only need to locate the Hymn Crystal somewhere in the lower world, but then figure out how to return to the upper levels of the tower! Gameplay features both an exploration mode and battle mode. When exploring you can wander around the many locations of Sol Ciel; you'll encounter numerous people to talk to, various towns and cities, as well as locate useful items. In many areas battles are randomly encountered; on the screen is a colored meter - beginning green, it slowly fades towards red. The closer to red the meter becomes, the greater your chances of randomly encountering a battle.\n\nBattles in the game are turn based; Lyner as well as other characters in your party each have the ability to perform attacks as well as utilize various skills. Throughout the game you will encounter several characters known as Reyvateils; Reyvateils have the unique ability to sing songs which can be crafted into powerful magic for attacking, healing, or defense. When a Reyvateil is in your party, she remains at the back during battles; you can give her commands on what songs to sing - the longer she sings, the more powerful the magic will become. However singing tires a Reyvateil, and if she sings for too long she becomes so tired the built up magic is lost so you need to make sure to give a command to activate the magic before that happens. Normally opponents don't attack a Reyvateil, only the characters on the front line. Occasionally though an enemy will target a Reyvateil; when this happens you need to make sure other characters protect her, for though Reyvateils can craft powerful magic they are mostly defenseless to enemy attacks! When all opponents in the battle have been defeated, the battle is won and points are earned which can level up your characters.\n\nThroughout the game you will need to help Reyvateils learn more powerful song magic. To do this you will need to dive into a Reyvateils cosmosphere. The cosmosphere is the world of her mind consisting of her private thoughts and emotions; when there you can interact with the Reyvateil and help her overcome obstacles to learn new songs. However since you are viewing her private thoughts, you first need to gain the trust of the Reyvateil. This is done by interacting in the real world first by talking; talk topics can be found in various locations throughout the world and also after various events. When you have enough talk topics completed you can then dive to the next level in the Reyvateils mind.\n\nAnother important skill Lyner learns early on is Grathmelding; this allows you to combine various items to form new ones. To do so, you will first need to locate a recipe so you know what to combine as well as Grathnode crystal to aid the process.

Instead, each separate city-state of South Esviore runs their own affairs, trading with one another but remaining mostly separate.\n\nThe situation with Regallzine is also tied with the fate of Avenberry, a legendary city of alchemists that existed many hundreds of years before the game's beginning. No one knows exactly what happened, but it is said that Avenberry fell because of the misuse of the alchemy that ran their lives. Many alchemists and treasure hunters have come to Avenberry to try to unlock its secrets since that time, and the city of Kavoc was built for that purpose. However, none have been able to get past the gate that guards the citadel, and Avenberry's secrets have so far been preserved.\n\nAlchemists today are few and far between, most basing their research on the studies of Iris, an alchemist who lived before the fall of Avenberry. They travel the world in search of new alchemaic artifacts for synthesis, ruins of the past, and Mana. The mana are a race of beings that allow alchemists to use their power. They augment the power of the elements which Alchemists extract from objects in the world and use them to create new and powerful magical items. Mana have feelings, emotions, and personalities just as people do, and many become good friends with their alchemist, although some people do forget about this fact.\n\nThe protagonist of the game, Klein Kiesling, is one of these wandering alchemists.

Viese becomes a full-fledged alchemist, and when she finds Felt at the Belkhyde Gate (a sealed gateway to another world), they go to a forest so Viese can make a pact with an elemental spirit. They find the Azure Azoth, an Excaliber-like sword, and Felt succeeds in pulling it out.\n\nHe hears a voice telling him he must go to Belkhyde (which has been unsealed by the Azure Azoth) because Eden is in turmoil. After parting from Viese, he staggers across the Tatalian desert before collapsing and being found by Noin. Noin claims to be part of the Simsilt, an army fighting to liberate Belkhyde from the Empire. Felt and Noin rescue Max, leader of the Simsilt, from the Riesevelt lighthouse and move to Agito Cove (Simsilt's base). Felt and Viese learn about the Share Ring, which allows a user to send items to another. Hagel (the blacksmith) is recruited, and they are rescued by the dragon man Gray. Felt returns to Agito, travels to the eastern continent and sees the sea for the first time.\n\nDuring the journey to Altena Church, Felt finds the girl who tried to kill him poisoned in a forest. After bringing her to Max's Camp, Viese develops a cure for Fungo's poison. Felt and the others go to Altena Church and are stopped by Chaos, who defeats Felt and Fee and is chased by Gray. When they reach Altena Church, the purposes of the Azoths, Eden and the Gardo Continental Drive are revealed. When Viese finds a map of workshops scattered across Belkhyde, this becomes the focus of the rest of the game.\n\nFelt looks for Chaos, who was not present at the battle. He finds an Altena Nun on the bridge leading to the western continent who tells him that Chaos arrived at Altena Church. When Felt arrives, he finds Mother Eizlen frozen by the Crimson Azoth's spell (which killed Max earlier). Felt fights Chaos in the lower levels of Altena Church (where the Gardo Continental Drive is stored), and is fossilized with the Exzanosis spell. Viese begins to worry about Felt, and follows him to Belkhyde.\n\nAfter the restoration of the Azure Azoth, Felt dissipates the mist which Palaxius spread over Eden.

He is now determined to do something for the people of Deep Earth, and perhaps even guide them to the surface of the planet.\n\nBreath of Fire V: Dragon Quarter is a radical departure from the previous titles of the Breath of Fire series, and in some ways from standard Japanese-style role-playing games in general. The game is built like a huge dungeon crawler, with no overworld map. The combat is tactical: each character has action points (AP), which can be used to move around the screen during an enemy encounter, and perform a variety of combo attacks. There is no magic in the game, and many of the items found in dungeons are random. All the enemies are visible on screen. Depending on who first initiated a physical contact, the party or the enemies get an extra turn in battles.\n\nThe game allows (and even encourages) the player to restart it from the beginning, keeping the items and the party experience. The game also features a special counter - Ryu can use his traditional dragon transformation abilities, but the counter raises with each such transformation, and when the counter reaches 100, the game is over.

This level lets the player learn the controls of the game and then fastforwards to the Guadalcanal (as though the training mission was a flashback) where the player must survive with his company. There are four more missions, two on the island of Betio and two on the island of Saipan.\n\nThe second part takes place in Europe after D-Day with four missions divided by two different experiences. The first two has the player take command of Pvt. Lucas Gibson of the American 80th Infantry Division as he and his squad make their way through Luxembourg and finally through Bastone mounted on a Sherman tank, trying to break through Nazi lines. The last two missions let the player take control of Pvt. Tom Sharpe of the British 6th Airbone Division, battling through the ruins of Bastone and the town of Bure.\n\nThe third part only consists of two missions that are divided between Pvt. Sharpe and Pvt. Gibson and is set in the closing days of the war in Europe. The first mission takes place in Wesel where Pvt. Sharpe and his division must find a way across the Rhine. The second has Pvt. Gibson and his division battle through the town of Braunau am Inn, the birthplace of Adolph Hitler, as they need to stop a V2 rocket from being launched.\n\nThe last campaign reverts back to Pvt. Joe Miller at the end of the Pacific Theatre, this time with two missions on the island of Okinawa, with the last mission having the player take Castle Shuri in an attempt to capture Okinawa and open the gate to the Japanese mainland.\n\nThe gameplay is of the first-person shooter kind and is told through in game cutscenes as well as stock footage of World War II, both black & white and color. The controls are basic, with a main weapon and secondary along with two grenades (smoke and frag). Movement is done through the left analog stick with aiming through the right one. Players can fire their weapon using the \"R1\" button and switch between using \"Triangle\", manually reloading them using the \"Square\" button and aim down the sight using the \"L1\" button. Jumping and hurling obstacles (when prompted) is done through the \"X\" button, a melee attack can be obtained through the \"R3\" button and sprinting through the \"L3\" button. The \"O\" button is used for crouching while holding the button down will let the player's character prone.\n\nPlayers can obtain ammo through fallen comrades and new weapons by standing over top of the weapon and holding the \"Square\" button. Likewise, fallen enemy weapons can be obtained this way. There is no number of preset lives and once a player is killed he can restart from a previous checkpoint. There is no health bar system, instead it resembles Medal of Honor: Vanguard where once the player starts to sustain an considerable amount of damage, the view will start to become red. This can be stopped by taking cover away from enemy fire which will allow the players health to replenish.", "publisher": "Activision Value Publishing", "developer": "Rebellion", "releaseDate": 20081111, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Call of Duty - World at War - Final Fronts.jpg"], "score": 3.5}, {"name": "Call of Duty 2 - Big Red One", "filename": "Call of Duty 2 - Big Red One.iso", "size": "2.72 GiB", "date": "20210704", "iconUrl": "covers/Call of Duty 2 - Big Red One.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Call of Duty 2 - Big Red One.jpg", "matchedName": "Call of Duty 2: Big Red One", "category": ["Shooter"], "description": "Call of Duty 2: Big Red One is a historical-military first-person shooter developed by Treyarch and published by Activision for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube on November 1, 2005.

The plot and characters have very little relation with the previous Clock Tower games. The story follows 14-year-old Alyssa Hamilton who is part of a family lineage of female warriors who travel through time to defeat evil spirits. Alyssa travels from her time in 2003 London to the 1940s and 1960s in order to defeat these \"Entities\" and bring peace to troubled souls. \n\nGameplay:\nPlayed from a fixed third-person camera perspective in which players control 14-year-old school girl Alyssa Hamilton. It's the first game in the series to incorporate direct control over the protagonist, as opposed to the point-and-click gameplay used in the previous games. To progress through the game, the player must find items to unlock new areas, solve puzzles, and flee and hide from enemies (\"Subordinates\"). Eventually, each Subordinate must be defeated in battle. Throughout each level, the player also encounters the spirits of innocent people slain by the Subordinates. These spirits will attack Alyssa if she approaches them. In order to pacify them, an item of sentimental value must be found and returned to the spirit's corpse.\n\nStory:\nThe story of Clock Tower 3 is set in London in 2003. Alyssa Hamilton is a 14-year-old girl who has been living at a boarding school for three years. Her mother, Nancy, sent her there after her grandfather, Dick, disappeared. The game begins with Alyssa receiving a letter from her mother telling her to go into hiding until after her fifteenth birthday. Alarmed, Alyssa decides to go against her mother's wishes and return home. However, when she arrives at the boarding house in which they live, her mother is absent, and the only person there is a man called \"The Dark Gentleman\". Determined to find her mother, Alyssa explores her mother's room.

One who sought hegemony. One who sought ambition. One who stood up for righteousness. Veterans who shared the same swarmed under each leader. These stalwart souls waged war across the vast expanse of the land and, like blood thirsty demons, cut down any and all who stood in their way.\n\nThey followed their own rules, they were both revered and feared by millions... they are the Dynasty Warriors.\n\nDynasty Warriors 3 takes place over the 50 years of war recounted in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, from the first flames of battle in the Yellow Turban Rebellion to the final battle between Wei and Shu on the plains of Wu Zhong. Over 40 characters are playable, both from the three main sides as well as leaders of lesser armies along the way. Each character that belongs to either Wu, Wei, or Shu has their own series of levels where they will turn the tide of battle for their force to win. Each character has their own unique weapon type and magic ability, although they can share weaker variations of weapons with other characters who use the same style of weapon. Weapons and items are dropped randomly from boxes in levels as well as from defeated enemy generals, and each has a range of stats dependent on the difficulty level and the strength of the general. The most powerful weapons and items, however, can only be collected by completing hidden objectives as each character. Characters grow more powerful by collecting stat up items from defeated generals, and doing well in levels rewards points that level up the bodyguards who follow the player character.\n\nMost completed levels can be replayed with any character and any side in free mode.

The player takes part in turn-based missions, which pit their group of wanzers against enemy forces. Old features that have returned include the ability to upgrade parts and mission branching. New features to Front Mission 5 include friendly fire and the ability to recruit new pilots.\nUnlike the previous games which were fairly standalone, Front Mission 5 covers the time period from 2070 to 2121. In effect, it goes through conflicts seen in the previous games as the years pass by. Through the eyes of U.S.N. soldier/officer Walter Feng, the player experiences his story as he deals with the aforementioned conflicts. With the passing of time, he becomes witness to hidden truths and accounts.

The game was upgraded to Tekken 5.1, which had mostly balance changes to the gameplay, and later an update Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection which was released for arcades in 2005 and later ported to the PlayStation Portable as Tekken: Dark Resurrection and on the PlayStation 3.\n\nThe game removes several major gameplay changes introduced in Tekken 4, such as uneven stage terrain, in favor of a faster gameplay akin to the older games in the series. It is also the first game in the series to feature the ability to customize characters with accessories, clothing, and other aesthetic items purchased with in-game currency. There are up to 32 characters to choose from, including seven new fighters. The home version includes a mode known as Devil Within, a variant of Tekken Force introduced in Tekken 3. Unlike Tekken 5.1 which merely tried to balance the game, the update Dark Resurrection adds a host of new content, especially in its home version for the PSP.\n\nTekken 5 was a critical and commercial success, selling over six million copies.

Every 25% of the game completed results in the player being awarded a car as a special prize. For GT3, the Gran Turismo Mode (Simulation Mode in the North American version) has a reorganized layout, with a more structured and progressive arrangement of races and challenges. Races vary from short beginner events to multi-hour endurance races and also rallying events against an opponent. In addition, the car shops are now organized by country and then by manufacturer, which some find to be more intuitive than the East/West City method used in its predecessor.\n\nThe Arcade Mode is reorganized in \"stages\"; these stages are made up of 5 or 6 tracks pooled from all available tracks in the game, including both road and rally races. To get to the next stage, all tracks on a stage must be completed on Easy difficulty or higher. By beating the stage on Normal or Difficult, additional cars are unlocked as well for play in any mode of Arcade Mode (including two-player battle and time trial).\n\nGT3 features 19 race courses, 14 of which have reverse variants' and 4 of which are dirt tracks. Most of these circuits are at fictional locations, but California's Laguna Seca Raceway and Côte d’Azur (which is heavily based on the Monaco Grand Prix circuit) are not.\n\nOther changes include the omission of the ability to \"race modify\" or add downforce to production cars, removal of suspension damage, and the absence of torque limits for races.\n\nNew to the franchise, GT3 also contained unlicensed versions of six actual Formula One cars, labelled as F686/M, F687/S, F688/S, F090/S, F094/H and F094/S (in the Japanese and American versions) that the player could win from endurance races. In the Japanese and American versions, the name of each car denotes various pieces of information (such as the amount of cylinders in the engine, the year the chassis was raced, and its driver, respectively). For example, the a forementioned F094/S was the 10-cylinder, 1994-season car driven by Ayrton Senna, whereas the F686/M represented the 6-cylinder, 1986-season car driven by Nigel Mansell. In the PAL release, however, there were only two F1 cars, not obviously based on any real-life counterparts and instead labelled as Polyphony 001 and 002 respectively.\n\nGT3 also marks informal appearances of automakers Lamborghini and Porsche. A racing JGTC Lamborghini Diablo was featured in the NTSC-J version (where the car has been cut from NTSC-U copy and being available in NTSC-U copy with a cheat device), and a Porsche 911 GT3 can be found in the game code (though it cannot be obtained normally, and requires the use of a cheat device). Both cars, together with two hidden Lancia Stratoses (road and rally versions), however, are completely absent in PAL version. Lamborghini would make its first official appearance in 2009's Gran Turismo (PSP), while Porsche made its first official appearance in Gran Turismo Sport for the PlayStation 4.", "releaseDate": 20010428, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Gran Turismo 3 - A-Spec [PS2 Bundle].jpg"], "score": 4.41}, {"name": "Gran Turismo 4", "filename": "Gran Turismo 4.iso", "size": "4.95 GiB", "date": "20181102", "iconUrl": "covers/Gran Turismo 4.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Gran Turismo 4.jpg", "matchedName": "Gran Turismo 4", "category": ["Racing"], "description": "It's more than a game.

It is dominated by the ruins and technologies of an ancient civilization, the Precursors. This civilization also created eco, a type of energy that comes in different colors and can be used to various effects. There’s the dark eco that can distort life, and its Dark Sage, Gol Acheron, is going to unleash it on the world. He sent his servants, the Lurkers, to gather eco for him.\n\n###Plot\nThe player assumes the role of Jak, a mute yet troublemaking teenage boy. His best friend is a boy called Daxter. When the two explored the forbidden ruins, the Lurkers attacked them. Daxter came under the influence of dark eco and mutated into a mixture of otter and weasel he calls “ottsel.” He can still talk, however, and will comment on Jak’s actions throughout the game. Jak learns that only Gol Acheron can bring Daxter back to normal. The boy, accompanied by Daxter on his shoulder, sets out on a dangerous journey to save his friend and the world.\n\n###Gameplay\nMuch of the gameplay is centered around collecting items and resources. On each level, Jak has to obtain power cells to activate Precursors’ machines and advance to the next area.

The assassins, physical manifestations of a man named Harman Smith, perform hits on behalf of the United States government. Through these missions, the killer7 uncover a deeper conspiracy regarding the role of Japan in U.S. politics and secrets about the nature of their organization. Killer7 features first-person shooter elements and a unique on rails control scheme, but the core adventure-style gameplay has been compared to Myst and Snatcher.\r\nKiller7 was Suda51's first game released outside Japan. It received polarized reviews due to its unconventional control scheme, linear gameplay, and complex noir plot. While some reviewers appreciated the stripped-down controls and stylized arthouse approach, others panned it as confusing and restricting. However, the game's soundtrack, presentation, visual style and thought-provoking story received generally positive responses from critics and considered as the best aspects of the game and lead to several accolades and nominations.

Kuon is based on an ancient type of Japanese horror story called a kaidan. The game is set in a mansion in Kyoto during the Heian Period of Japan. \n\nIn Kuon's Yin Phase (Chapter of Shadow), Utsuki and Kureha arrive at the Fujiwara mansion to find their father. At the same time, during the game's Yang Phase (Chapter of Light), Doman's disciples, including Sakuya and her older brother, enter the manor to investigate the strange incidents occurring there. Utsuki and Sakuya become separated from their respective groups, and occasionally cross paths with one another.\n\nAs the story progresses, the protagonists learn of Doman's true evil nature. The strange occurrences are a result of Doman's attempts with performing the forbidden Kuon ritual. which involves fusing a person with other corpses inside of a massive silkworm cocoon. Once this is done nine times, the person is \"reborn\". Doman sees his disciples, the manor residents, and even his daughters as expendable in his pursuit to form the Kuon cocoon.\n\nOne by one, Sakuya's fellow exorcists died and resurrect into undead monsters. Meanwhile, Kureha, revealed to have died before the game's events, merges with Sakuya's older brother, becoming a hideous abomination. Later, Utsuki and Sakuya separately enter the underground area beneath the manor, where Doman is working to perform the Kuon spell. Utsuki becomes fused with other corpses eight times; slowly driven mad, she attacks Sakuya.\n\nIn the Kuon Phase, Utsuki comes to her senses and releases Sakuya. Utsuki begs Sakuya to get away from her, but the latter vows to find a way to save her. At this time, Abe no Seimei arrives. After meeting with Sakuya, and later with a deformed Utsuki, Seimei finds and battles Doman, who seeks to use Seimei's body for the final cocoon. After Seimei kills Doman, Utsuki, unable to stop herself, drags Doman's body away and locks herself with it inside a wicker basket, thus beginning the final phase of the Kuon ritual. Sakuya convinces Seimei not to kill Utsuki, and the master exorcist reluctantly decides not to.\n\nDuring the ending credits, Sakuya coaxes Utsuki—now reborn as a young girl—out of the Fujiwara mansion grounds.

It was released on 11 September 2006. Part of the Lego Star Wars series, it is based on the Star Wars science fiction media franchise and Lego Group's Star Wars-themed toy line. It follows the events of the Star Wars films Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The game allows players to assume the roles of over 50 Lego versions of characters from the film series; customized characters can also be created. Camera movement was improved from its predecessor—Lego Star Wars: The Video Game; and the concept of \"vehicle levels\" was explored more thoroughly. The game was revealed at American International Toy Fair 2006. Promotions for the game were set up at chain stores across the United States.\nLego Star Wars II was critically and commercially successful; it has sold over 8.2 million copies worldwide as of May 2009. Critics praised the game for its comedic and \"adorable\" portrayal of the film series and for their preference of the original trilogy to the prequel trilogy. However, the game's low difficulty, and its Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions in general, were received more poorly. The game received awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and Spike TV, among others. A mobile phone adaptation, Lego Star Wars II Mobile, was later developed by Universomo, published by THQ, and released on 19 December 2006.

It was ported to the Game Boy Advance by Griptonite Games, to the GameCube by Hypnos Entertainment, and to mobile by JAMDAT. A version for Microsoft Windows developed by Ritual Entertainment was cancelled during development. The game was published on all platforms by Electronic Arts. Originally released in North America for the PlayStation 2 in October 2002, it was released in November for the Game Boy Advance, in December for the Xbox and GameCube, and in May 2003 for mobile. In November 2003, EA released a sequel, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.\nThe game is an adaptation of Peter Jackson's 2001 film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and his 2002 film The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, which was released shortly after the game. As it is not an adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's 1954 novel The Two Towers, the second volume in his Lord of the Rings trilogy, anything from the novel not specifically mentioned or depicted in the films could not be represented in the game. This is because, at the time, Vivendi Universal Games, in partnership with Tolkien Enterprises, held the rights to the video game adaptations of Tolkien's literary works, whilst Electronic Arts held the rights to the video game adaptations of the New Line Cinema films. EA chose not to publish a game based on Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring film, instead incorporating some of the plot and footage into their The Two Towers game, which was released a few weeks after Vivendi's The Fellowship of the Ring game, a licensed adaptation of Tolkien's novel The Fellowship of the Ring.\nThe Two Towers received a generally positive response, with critics praising the re-creation of sets and scenes from the films, and the epic scope of some of the battles. Some, however, criticized the game for being too short and the combat overly repetitive. The game was a financial success, selling almost four million units, and outselling Vivendi's The Fellowship of the Ring game, which sold just over one million.", "publisher": "Electronic Arts", "developer": "Stormfront Studios", "releaseDate": 20021021, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Lord of the Rings, The - The Two Towers.jpg"], "score": 3.92}, {"name": "Lupin the 3rd - Treasure of the Sorcerer King", "filename": "Lupin the 3rd - Treasure of the Sorcerer King.iso", "size": "4.30 GiB", "date": "20231213", "iconUrl": "covers/Lupin the 3rd - Treasure of the Sorcerer King.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Lupin the 3rd - Treasure of the Sorcerer King.jpg", "matchedName": "Lupin the 3rd: Treasure of the Sorcerer King", "category": ["Adventure", "Action"], "description": "Fantastic heists, impossible escapes, and busty brunettes - all in a day's work for a thief.

Deadly Alliance is chronologically the fifth main game in the Mortal Kombat series.

The first version, also titled Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance was released on November 2002, during the same week as the home console versions, while the second GBA version, Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition (originally titled Mortal Kombat: Deadly Revenge, which was printed in the manual), was released on August 25, 2003.", "publisher": "Midway Games", "developer": "Midway Games", "releaseDate": 20021116, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Mortal Kombat - Deadly Alliance.jpg"], "score": 79}, {"name": "Mortal Kombat - Deception", "filename": "Mortal Kombat - Deception.iso", "size": "4.36 GiB", "date": "20181102", "iconUrl": "covers/Mortal Kombat - Deception.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Mortal Kombat - Deception.jpg", "matchedName": "Mortal Kombat: Deception", "category": ["Fighting"], "description": "Mortal Kombat: Deception is a fighting video game developed and published by Midway as the sixth installment of the Mortal Kombat (MK) video game franchise. It was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in October 2004, and for the Nintendo GameCube in March 2005. Mortal Kombat: Deception follows the storyline from the fifth installment, Deadly Alliance. Its story centers on the revival of the Dragon King Onaga, who attempts to conquer the realms featured in the series after defeating the sorcerers Quan Chi and Shang Tsung, the main antagonists in the previous game, and the Thunder God Raiden, defender of Earthrealm. The surviving warriors from the previous titles join forces to confront Onaga.\nTwenty-six characters are available to play in the game, with nine making their first appearance in the series. Deception contains several new features in the series, such as chess and puzzle games with the MK characters and an online mode. The Konquest Mode returns from Deadly Alliance, but follows the life of Shujinko, a warrior who is deceived by Onaga to search for artifacts to give Onaga more powers. In November 2006, Midway released Mortal Kombat: Unchained, a port for the PlayStation Portable, which adds characters to the game from the previous title.\nSeries co-creator Ed Boon designed Deception to be an unpredictable fighting game, and included new features such as the minigames as surprises. Several parts from Deadly Alliance such as combos and arenas were redesigned to be more realistic as well as more interactive. Deception has been well received by video game reviewers, who praised the fights and the new features. The Konquest Mode, however, received criticism for poor voice acting.

It was developed by EA Tiburon and released on August 31, 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox and on September 4, 2004 for the GameCube. NASCAR 2005 is the first game in the series to drop the word Thunder from the title since NASCAR 2001. Kevin Harvick, driver of the No. 29 GM Goodwrench Chevy Monte Carlo, appeared on the cover replacing Jeremy Mayfield who was originally to have been on the cover. It also marks the first time the original PlayStation has been excluded from the NASCAR lineup. This was the first NASCAR edition to be released exclusively on six generation home consoles.\nUnlike previous entries, which would normally add a few extra features but leave most of the game identical to its predecessor, the game brought massive change to the series. One example is the inclusion of NASCAR series other than the NASCAR Cup Series; the Busch Series (renamed the National Series to avoid an M rating from the ESRB for alcohol advertising, though the series is still referred to in-game as the Busch Series by the player's agent and Bill Weber), the Craftsman Truck Series, and the Featherlite Modified Series, plus production cars and the Daytona Prototypes of the Rolex Sports Car Series. More examples include the implementation of NASCAR's new Chase for the Cup points system, and Fight to the Top mode, where the player controls a custom driver throughout his career starting in the lower series and working up the ladder (similar to NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona). Another change is the absence of the cockpit view and the absence of makes and models in the Truck series, all of which appear to be Ford F-150s. Also due to failed negotiations with licensing Pocono Raceway is not included. This was the last NASCAR game released for the Nintendo GameCube.

Slightly more than your typical grunt, Nick belongs to the Psi-Ops division, a section devoted to tapping into latent human psychic and telekinetic powers and exploiting them for military purposes.\n\nScryer's latest mission is to infiltrate and take down a psychic terrorist organization known as 'The Movement'. These mentally-enhanced menaces have been kidnapping troops and manipulating their minds to turn them into unfeeling, unthinking 'Meat Puppets', and it's Scryer's task to put an end to it. As he's attempting to penetrate an organization run by mind-readers, extreme measures have been taken to prevent detection.\n\nScryer has his mind-wiped and his face completely altered to prevent detection by former friends, which leaves him without any knowledge of his powerful psychic powers. Soon after, he's incarcerated after being captured by The Movement, and it's in this prison that he becomes your personal meat puppet.\n\nHelp Nick to gradually rediscover his devastating mental abilities - including pyrokinesis (the power to manipulate fire), remote viewing (see through walls and doors), and mind control - in Midway's stunning and highly original new adventure.\n\n###Details\n\nIt's Nick Scryer's psionic abilities that set Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy apart from the myriad action-adventure titles on the market. Abilities such as telekinesis, which allows you to lift and throw objects - including humans - around are not only intuitive to control but great fun with it. This is largely down to the brilliant Havok physics engine, which makes all items react realistically to your actions. Send a barrel flying into a stack of boxes, and they'll all come crashing down; 'grab' an enemy, and you can repeatedly smash them into walls or even shoot at them as they hover helplessly in the air.\n\nAnd that's only one of the six powers on offer. Set fire to an object using pyrokinesis, and you can use it to set surrounding objects aflame too; use mind control to take over a foe and use him to blast his accomplices before forcing him to throw himself down a chasm; or sneak behind an unwitting Meat Puppet and use mind drain to sap his psionic energy and blow his head up in the process...\n\nThe possibilities are numerous, and the game doesn't shy away from giving you an opportunity to improvise with what you have. Need to cross a huge gap with plenty of gun-toting fiends on the other side? Well, you could create a bridge using the objects around you, surf across on a suitably-shaped item, or just use mind control to deal with the distant threat and then safely walk around the hole.

The sixth major installment in the Resident Evil series, it was originally released for the GameCube in 2005. Players control U.S. government special agent Leon S. Kennedy, who is sent on a mission to rescue the U.S. president's daughter Ashley Graham, who has been kidnapped by a cult. In a rural part of Europe, Leon fights hordes of villagers infected by a mind-controlling parasite, and reunites with the spy Ada Wong.\nDevelopment began for PlayStation 2 in 1999. Four proposed versions were discarded; the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami. In a departure from the fixed camera angles and slower survival horror gameplay of previous instalments, the team focused on developing more dynamic shooting action.\nResident Evil 4 was announced as a GameCube exclusive as part of the Capcom Five, but was ported to numerous formats, becoming a cross-platform hit, selling over 10 million copies across all platforms. It garnered acclaim for its narrative, gameplay, voice acting, and characters, and is often named one of the best video games, winning multiple Game of the Year awards in 2005. It influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person genres, popularizing the \"over-the-shoulder\" third-person view. Resident Evil 5 was released in 2009.\n\n#Gameplay\nThe player controls the protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, from a third-person perspective. Departing significantly from the series' previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.\nResident Evil 4 adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, players can interact with the environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, dodging an attack or executing a \"finishing move\" on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events, in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game's many boss fights, in which the player must avoid instant-kill attacks.\nThe main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados (\"The Cattle\" in Spanish). Los Ganados can dodge, wield melee and projectile weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other.\nThe inventory system features a grid system, represented by an attaché case, that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition, and healing items are kept in the case, while key items and treasures are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.\nCapcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases. The largest addition is \"Separate Ways\", a minigame which focuses on Ada Wong's involvement in Resident Evil 4 and her connection to the series' villain Albert Wesker. \"Ada's Report\", a five-part documentary, analyzes Ada's relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot. Other unlockable content in all versions includes the minigames \"The Mercenaries\" and \"Assignment Ada\" (using Ada to retrieve Las Plagas samples), new costumes for Leon and Ashley, new weapons, and a cutscene browser.\n\n#Plot\nU.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S. President's daughter, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult. He travels to a nameless rural village in Spain, where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Illuminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas.\nWhile in the village, Leon is captured by its chief, Bitores Mendez, and injected with Las Plagas. He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano), a former Los Illuminados researcher. The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her. They both escape from the church after Osmund Saddler (Michael Gough), leader of Los Illuminados, reveals his plan to use the plaga they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with a \"sample\" once she returns home, allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world.\nAfter killing Mendez, Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more Illuminados under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica), another of Saddler's henchmen who owns the castle, and the two become separated by Salazar's traps. Meanwhile, Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon and Ashley's infection, as well as a sample of Las Plagas. He brings the two items to Leon but is killed by Saddler, who takes the sample, while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon's hands. While in the castle, Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill), a woman from his past who supports him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.\nAfterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping. Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample. Suspicious of the mercenary's intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit. After Krauser's fatal defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler, and with Ada's help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island explodes.", "publisher": "Ubisoft Entertainment", "developer": "Capcom", "releaseDate": 20050111, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Resident Evil 4.jpg"], "score": 83}, {"name": "Return to Castle Wolfenstein - Operation Resurrection", "filename": "Return to Castle Wolfenstein - Operation Resurrection.iso", "size": "2.24 GiB", "date": "20181026", "iconUrl": "covers/Return to Castle Wolfenstein - Operation Resurrection.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Return to Castle Wolfenstein - Operation Resurrection.jpg", "matchedName": "Return to Castle Wolfenstein", "category": ["Shooter"], "description": "Return to Castle Wolfenstein is an FPS developed within Wolfenstein franchise in 2001. It rebooted the series and was the fifth part of the intellectual property. The game functions on the Quake III: Arena engine.\n\n###Plot\nThe whole series and the Return, in particular, depict the events of the World War II. The game tells a story of the year 1943 and follows the story arc of the agent Blazkowicz and Agent One who infiltrated the Nazi base and found themselves captured and sent to the Castle Wolfenstein. The narrative centers around their escape past the overpowered enemies called \"übersoldaten\" and figuring out the solution to the multiple mazes.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game is one of the progenitors of the corridor shooters — the notion has not been spoiled yet, and the strictly linear games were the classics of the genre. Although the title exploits the basic mechanics of shooting enemies and moving around the territory, the player is suggested with some firearms and tools. \nThere is a multiplayer which is based on a number of the quests and two teams set to accomplish them. The team who achieves the primary goal first wins. There are three modes: an objective, stopwatch, and checkpoint. Objective aims at the fulfilling the goal, and stopwatch controls the progress achieved within the period, and checkpoint fixes the progress at its milestones.", "publisher": "Bethesda Softworks", "developer": "Nerve Software", "releaseDate": 20011120, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Return to Castle Wolfenstein - Operation Resurrection.jpg"], "score": 88}, {"name": "Rez", "filename": "Rez.iso", "size": "191.65 MiB", "date": "20220823", "iconUrl": "covers/Rez.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Rez.jpg", "matchedName": "Rez", "category": ["Shooter", "Action"], "description": "Rez is a musical rail shooter developed by United Game Artists and published by Sega for the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2. It was released in Japan on November 2001, followed by releases to the United States and Europe in January 2002. The game has since seen two remasters: Rez HD, released to the Xbox Live Arcade in 2008, and Rez Infinite, developed for PlayStation VR and released to the PlayStation Network in October 2016 and Microsoft Windows in August 2017. Inspired by the work of Russian painter, Wassily Kandinsky, the game was developed under the working title K-Project, and was conceptualized and produced by Tetsuya Mizuguchi. Rez is notable for replacing the typical sound effects found in most rail shooters with electronic music. The player creates sounds and melodies as they target and destroy foes in the game, leading to a form of synesthesia.\nThe game's development team contained several former members of the disbanded Team Andromeda, the Sega development team behind the Panzer Dragoon series. Rez Infinite, the latest version of the game created for virtual reality, was released to widespread acclaim, and is widely considered to be one of the best VR games to date.\nIn 2007, a beta-build version of Rez was released for the Sega Dreamcast exclusively in Japan, titled Vibes as a promotional item for the then-upcoming Rez HD for the Xbox 360.", "publisher": "SEGA", "developer": "Sonic Team", "releaseDate": 20011122, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Rez.jpg"], "score": 84}, {"name": "Ridge Racer V", "filename": "Ridge Racer V.iso", "size": "623.00 MiB", "date": "20200901", "iconUrl": "covers/Ridge Racer V.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Ridge Racer V.jpg", "matchedName": "Ridge Racer V", "category": ["Racing"], "publisher": "Sony Interactive Entertainment", "developer": "NAMCO", "releaseDate": 20000304, "score": 78}, {"name": "Ring of Red", "filename": "Ring of Red.iso", "size": "483.85 MiB", "date": "20220817", "iconUrl": "covers/Ring of Red.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Ring of Red.jpg", "matchedName": "Ring of Red", "category": ["Strategy"], "releaseDate": 20000921, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Ring of Red.jpg"]}, {"name": "Rise of the Kasai", "filename": "Rise of the Kasai.iso", "size": "4.36 GiB", "date": "20201030", "iconUrl": "covers/Rise of the Kasai.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Rise of the Kasai.jpg", "matchedName": "Rise of the Kasai", "category": ["Action"], "description": "Experience Rise of the Kasai™ for PS2™ system with 1080p up-rendering and Trophies.

Countless spheres of light are emitted by the Pod and infect Serf and his comrades, awakening their demonic powers. An unimaginable battle unfolds within their faint conscience. They develop a desire to tear the flesh and shatter the bones of their enemies, who have also been transformed. Their instincts tell them to devour every being in their path. Until then, Serf and his comrades only knew of battle, but for the first time, they experience new emotions. At that time, a dark-haired girl, Sera, comes to their rescue. Although she does not know where she came from, she holds a strange power - the power to control the party's demonic transformation.

You are sent through the world to battle Gig's minions on grid-based battlefields with a party of your creation. Your group is composed of soldiers you purchase with Gig points, and you must set them up on the battleground so that their attributes and skills are put to good use.

Although some character names have been borrowed from The Wizard of Oz, the similarity ends there.\nThe hero and main character is Fiel (\"Feel\" in the Japanese version), a boy who lost his parents at a young age and was raised by his sister Dorothy. Although they are human, Fiel and Dorothy can tap into their world's magical power, Etheria. Toto, their special cat, is able to transform itself into a sword. The brother and sister share their ability with the Katina, spiritual creatures captured and employed by evil gods to tyrannize mankind. Feel frees two Katina (Almira and Leon) and they join with him on his quest to vanquish the evil gods, rescue their world and reclaim the life-giving power of Etheria.\nThe story unfolds during 20 chapters called \"stages\". Gameplay includes exploration of the world in a free-roaming style, conversations with NPCs and party members. Objects and animals in the environment can be destroyed to find valuable items. Combat relies heavily on teamwork and how well the player works with the AI-controlled companions. Attack combinations during battle involve passing an enemy back and forth between party members. The more adept the player becomes in handling the chained combat moves, the more bonuses and rankings can be gained.\nEach character can be equipped with various armor, weaponry, and enchanted items like rings and necklaces. Items are found or can be purchased within the game.\nDialog choices during gameplay effect the \"affection\" value of Almira and Leon. A partner with a higher ranking in this area will chain up your combo/pass more frequently. There are at least three different endings which are determined by which mode you are playing as well as your dialog choices.\nThe game features Easy, Normal and Hard difficulty modes. The main difference between these modes is the amount and types of enemies that appear, items found in chests and dropped by enemies, and the respawn rate in some boss battles.\nIn Story Mode, only Feel can be controlled until later stages when another one of the trio can be selected.

Excellent reviews and 92/100 score on Metacritic is a serious indicator. In the Steam community, there are still enthusiastic nostalgic reviews of almost everything that concerns Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory. And there is an explanation for this. The game was released in 2005 and became the third in the Splinter Cell series. Canadian studio Ubisoft Montreal was engaged in the development, who is also responsible for Assassin's Creed and Far Cry. Critics and player noted the Xbox and PC versions of the game as the best. \n\n###The story\nIn Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, the player will feel like a professional spy, NSA agent Sam Fisher from a special unit called “The Third Echelon.” The plot takes its origin from the first game in the series. However, the narrative is constructed in such a way that the player does not necessarily have to go through it in order to enjoy the story. The events of the game occur in different parts of the Earth that are based on places from the real world. At the heart of the game is the conflict unfolding between China, North Korea, South Korea, and Japan.\n\nIn addition to a single user campaign, there is the possibility of playing on the net. However, the official online services for this game were disabled as early as August 2016. Despite this, players still have the opportunity to play on the local network or, with due skill - through third-party services.", "publisher": "Ubisoft Entertainment", "developer": "Ubisoft", "releaseDate": 20050321, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell 3 - Chaos Theory.jpg"], "score": 92}, {"name": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell", "filename": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell.iso", "size": "2.64 GiB", "date": "20220410", "iconUrl": "covers/Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell.jpg", "matchedName": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell", "category": ["Adventure", "Action"], "description": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell is a stealth-action game developed by Ubisoft Montreal.

Third Echelon's agents are free to violate any law as long as it is required to complete the mission successfully.\n\nIn 2004, contact is lost with a CIA agent.

On the night of the King's murder, Allura is accused of killing him by her stepmother, Catalina. With the help of her friend Rachel, Allura is able to escape into a forest. On the run from assassins, she acquires the ability to set a series of traps, which are the only means she has of defending herself from her pursuers.\n\n-GAMEPLAY-\nPlayers begin by equipping and making traps for Allura to take with her into the game mission. Each mission starts in a specific room, where players can position traps in order to defeat enemies. The traps are classified into three types according to where they can be positioned within the game world (wall, ceiling, and floor). The player is allowed to take up to three traps of each type into a game stage, and additional traps can be obtained by completing the game. Enemies' life bars are shown at the top of the screen, while Allura's life bar and active traps are shown at the bottom left and right respectively. As the player defeats enemies they are rewarded with \"warl\", the game's currency, which can be used to purchase new traps between missions. Players may also purchase room keys, which allow Allura to access other rooms in the game missions. Apart from the main story missions, the game also includes several \"side stories\", which are optional missions that give different angles and insights into the game's main story. There are three official endings in the game, and a fourth that is not registered when saved onto the game file.\n\nApart from regular traps, Trapt introduces \"Dark Illusions\", which are pre-existing traps found throughout the mansion. Each is located in a different room and has a different effect upon an enemy. Each Dark Illusion requires certain criteria to be fulfilled before activation and can only be used once per level.\n\nPrincess Allura must save her kingdom by luring her enemies into traps she has set.

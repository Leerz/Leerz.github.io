The game is based on the 1957 novel and the film of the same name. The game follows the storyline of the book and film, with adding in new scenes to make the game more action-oriented, as well as changing the affiliation of the main villains.

Although the positive impact of this revolution is obvious, every coin has a flipside; for every beneficial device developed with these new materials, so too were advanced weapons and other implements of war. Thus, the land became mired with turmoil, and remains in such a state even now.\nEnter, the bracers: an organization established to serve as police and intermediaries alike, holding above all else the peace and safety of the lands under their jurisdiction. Whenever a citizen is in need of assistance, he or she may place a request at the local Bracer Guild -- and be it monster extermination, crime prevention or even peace talks among warring nations, the bracers will do whatever they can to resolve the matter cleanly and efficiently.\nSome matters require a gentler touch than others, however. When an orbalship transporting a legendary \"S-rank\" bracer named Cassius Bright suddenly goes missing, said bracer's daughter, Estelle, and adoptive son, Joshua, must join forces in search of him across the entire Kingdom of Liberl.\nAnd what they find along the way could change both of their lives forever...\nHailed as one of the largest, longest and most meticulously detailed turn-based JRPG series of all time, this first chapter in the ongoing Trails saga sets the stage for what's quickly become Ys developer Nihon Falcom's most popular and best-selling franchise in their entire 30+ year history.

And sometimes, it's just the memory of other people. And one more thing. The visual novel \"ECHO\" is a game in which you decide for yourself what to do with the oppressive silence of difficult memories. Emotional swamps of burnt rural lives. Forgotten houses, abandoned villages. And a fluttering light of hope that everything will be fine. Enter an abandoned house with echoes of other people's lives. And get out of it if you can.\nThe visual novel \"ECHO\" was created by the project \"Baba Nyura\", which collects folk mythical folklore. It was Baba Nyura who created such short stories as \"Whispers\" and \"The Sin\". Many of Baba Nyura's projects were created solely on the basis of materials collected in the field. ECHO was no exception. In addition to sharp social plots and a sea of ​​suspicious sounds in the new game, perhaps the most important topic of folk mythical folklore is revealed in detail. The theme of the cult of the dead, which we are used to seeing in everyday things in front of us. The ability to make choices that affect the plot will allow players to see the ending that will be closest to them.

The game has received numerous enhanced remakes for the WonderSwan Color, the PlayStation, the Game Boy Advance, the PlayStation Portable, and multiple mobile and smartphone types. As neither this game nor Final Fantasy III were initially released outside Japan, Final Fantasy IV was originally released in North America as Final Fantasy II, so as not to confuse players. The most recent releases of the game are enhanced versions for the iOS and Android, which were released worldwide in 2010 and 2012, respectively.\nThe game's story centers on four youths whose parents were killed during an army invasion by the empire of Palamecia, who are using hellspawn to conquer the world. Three of the four main characters join a rebellion against the empire, embarking on missions to gain new magic and weapons, destroy enemy superweapons, and rescue leading members of the resistance. The Game Boy Advance remake adds a bonus story after the game is completed.\nFinal Fantasy II introduced many elements that would later become staples of the Final Fantasy franchise, including chocobos and the recurring character Cid. It also eliminated the traditional experience point leveling system of the previous and later games in the series, instead introducing an activity-based progression system where the characters' statistics increase according to how they are used or acquired. Despite being a sequel to Final Fantasy, the game includes no characters or locations from the first game.

The game follows the storyline of the book and film, with adding in new scenes to make the game more action-oriented, as well as changing the affiliation of the main villains.

The game is an endless side-scrolling runner, the first time it appeared on devices running the iOS. Later the game was ported to other platforms, among which two unusual for the first decade of the twenty-first century: browsers in the form of the flash game and Sony Playstation Portable. The last game could be downloaded using the PlayStation Network. The game is often compared to another mobile hit of the era - the game Fruit Ninja, in which the player needs to cut fruits.\n\n###Key features\nThe game uses simple one-button control, for which the player can quickly adapt. Pressing the button raises the main character, and if the player releases the button, the protagonist falls. The game has a huge number of upgrades and a lot of enemies. Levels are full of obstacles, in order to get to the next, you need to fly a certain distance, after which the visual style of surroundings and enemies will change. The further you fly, the harder it is.\n\n###Continuous support\nDespite being released a long time ago, developers are still updating the game. The story tells about Barry Steakfries, who worked as a vendor in the gramophone manufacturer. The company eventually closed due to poor sales and the main character ended wandering the streets where he stumbles upon a jetpack. Dreaming of such a device in childhood, the main character does not hesitate to put it on and goes on the adventure.", "publisher": "Halfbrick", "developer": "Big Ant Studios", "releaseDate": 20110901, "score": 90}, {"name": "Jewel Keepers Easter Island.US.NPUZ-00081.PSN.Good", "filename": "Jewel Keepers Easter Island.US.NPUZ-00081.PSN.Good.cso", "size": "16.59 MiB", "date": "20201108", "iconUrl": "covers/Jewel Keepers Easter Island.US.NPUZ-00081.PSN.Good.jpg", "matchedName": "Jewel Keepers: Easter Island", "category": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "description": "Welcome to Jewel Keepers: Easter Island, an absorbing match-three\narcade-action game with mind-blowing visuals and an engaging storyline.\nThis game will keep you entertained for hours as you travel across\nEaster Island and help to unravel its mysteries.\n", "publisher": "Nordcurrent", "developer": "Nordcurrent", "releaseDate": 20101117}, {"name": "Jikandia The Timeless Land.US.ULUS-10562.UMD.Good", "filename": "Jikandia The Timeless Land.US.ULUS-10562.UMD.Good.iso", "size": "161.31 MiB", "date": "20201105", "iconUrl": "covers/Jikandia The Timeless Land.US.ULUS-10562.UMD.Good.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Jikandia The Timeless Land.US.ULUS-10562.UMD.Good.jpg", "matchedName": "Jikandia: The Timeless Land", "category": ["Action", "RPG"], "description": "Jikandia: The Timeless Land takes you the player (male or female) along with your friends from school and transports them to the land of Jikandia where time doesn't exist.\nHelp guide your friends through the perils of Jikandia and save the people whose time was lost along with the Jikandia native, Temtem.

Tenrai, an evil wizard who wants to get his hands on them, commands a band of his men to take the Jewels from whoever possesses them. However, upon encountering Rikimaru, he seems interested in his power and attempts convincing him to join his men. Rikimaru refuse, and he and Ayame face each one of them.

Every card is more than a means for achieving victory: it's also part of a living, breathing world. This also plays to our studio’s experience in making AAA action games.Design for deep CCG strategy\nThe combination of tactical action with familiar CCG strategy opens the door to a new kind of adventure game. We are happy that the creator of Ascension and Solforge, Justin Gary and his team at Stone Blade have joined us to add their decades of experience playing and designing CCGs to our own. Together we are exploring this new frontier and discovering new possibilities for rich gameplay.Create an expansive world rich in culture--both magical and familiar\nWe are passionate game developers.  We want that to shine through in Labyrinth. In crafting the diverse world of Hylea, whether we are describing the Cosmos and creation story of Starfall or the jewelry of a Giant from the Northern Clans, we strive to have our passion and attention to detail reflect in every facet of story and art.Build a game that will last for decades\nFirst and foremost, Labyrinth is a collectible card game. With their hallmarks of creative play, endless combinations, meta-game thinking and the potential for vast expansion, CCGs offer the best and longest-lasting experiences in gaming. We've captured these proven qualities and folded them into an exciting new game.\nThe Four Disciplines of Magic\nThe disciplines of magic in Labyrinth each correspond to energy drawn from a different source within the Cosmos.  They grant their wielders unique abilities that define a particular style of play.\nPractitioners of Warfare magic draw their power from the Spirit plane, a realm ruled by the eternal souls of ancient warlords. Warriors enhance their strength by channeling the might of their heroic ancestors. Warfare prefers a strategy that dominates through brute strength and outlasts with sheer indomitable will.\nWizards, Sorcerers, and Arcanists draw energy from the Elemental plane, a swirling and chaotic maelstrom of raw energy and matter, inhabited by strange animate essences of Fire, Frost, Air, and Earth. Wizardry combines these primal forces to form hulking monstrosities, or it unleashes their raw power with devastating torrents of magic. Wizards wield the most powerful effects in the game, but at the expense of endurance.\nDevotees of Faith magic draw on the favor of the Celestial plane, a vast realm inhabited by gods and demigods as numerous as the humans of Hylea. Celestial beings are fickle and fundamentally alien-- but when they choose to involve themselves in the struggles of humankind, their favors are often decisive. Faith prefers to maintain control of the entire battle, stalling the largest threats while crushing the weak with the will of the gods.\nUnlike the other three disciplines, Skulduggerists do not draw their power from a far-flung realm, but from within, directly ingesting Stardust to enhance their own innate traits. This grants them incredible reflexes, insight, and intellect. Engineers create wonders of mechanical ingenuity. Rogues gain powers of deception and agility. Skulduggerists prefer a strategy where they stay elusive until the perfect moment, then strike to maximum effect.Hero and Boss Cards\nThese cards form the heart of a player's collection. On a raid, players control a party of three Heroes, each with its own deck. On defense, players may control a number of Bosses that grows with their dungeon. Each Boss also has its own deck.\nHeroes and Bosses all have their own unique special ability that encourages certain play-styles and deck building synergies.  A Hero or Boss card also defines which of the four disciplines of magic that character may use.Offense Cards\nAttack cards form the core of a Hero’s deck. Each of the four disciplines of magic specializes in a different style of attack. For instance, Warfare prefers to close distance and crush its foes with large, devastating strikes, while Wizardry opts to stay at range and roast or shatter groups of enemies with area-effect spells. Each discipline also has its own special resource which further reinforces a particular style of play.\nDefense Cards\nMinion cards are the core of most Boss decks. They represent allies pulled from across Hylea and the Cosmos, and summoned to defend your lair.  Each Boss draws on a different style of magic when summoning Minions. Mechanical Bosses draw on enhanced powers of the mind to assemble autonomous terrors, while Divine Bosses curry favor with the gods to summon strange and powerful beings from the Celestial realm.  Some cards directly enhance the Boss or allow it to perform a devastating one-time attack.\nThe Cosmos of Labyrinth\nA great crack tore open the sky. As the farthest reaches of the realm shook with unnatural thunder, thousands of eyes looked up to see their peaceful night shattered into a shimmering prismatic storm. From a fissure in the heart of the tempest, a white star streaked, trailing fire and glowing brighter as it plummeted. Where it crashed to earth it swept into being an enormous crater that crackled and thrummed with otherworldly power.\nIn time, the crater was filled by the water of the Jarum river, and became a great lake. The first visitors were pilgrims following the path of the star, which they named the Prophet’s Tear. They soon discovered that the site was laced with a powdery substance that granted strange and extraordinary powers. They also found the Keyrifts--tiny bubbles in reality through which they could peer into other dimensions. As word spread of these discoveries, a sprawling city began to spring up around the rim of the crater: the City of Starfall.\nA robust trade in Stardust mined from the crater developed.  Men and women came from distant lands and settled in the city's many colorful ethnic wards. Prosperity brought peace and peace ruled over the city for centuries.\nNow, the age-old pacts and alliances are breaking down.  The earliest settlers have consolidated their power and look to push out rivals.  Newcomers to the city seek to carve out territory for themselves.  As night falls, a silent war begins in the tunnels, alleys, and halls of the ancient city.

It is considered one of the most hardcore installments of the series. Unlike many of its predecessors, it is oriented towards the actual driving simulation rather than arcade racing.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe creators of Shift aimed to realistically imitate the driving experience, making the game harder than an average NFS game. However, Shift automatically adjusts the difficulty depending on the player's experience and skills. Before the player enters the career, he or she has to complete a test drive at the famous Brands Hatch track to familiarize the game with his or her driving abilities. \n\n###Cars\nNeed for Speed: Shift offers a roster of more than 60 vehicles. As in most Need for Speed games, the player starts with a small amount of money and only a handful of available vehicles. To unlock and purchase better cars, the player has to win races. The cars in Need for Speed: Shift consists of four classes called \"tiers\". The lowest tier contains the cheapest and slowest cars, while supercars from manufacturers like Lamborghini and Bugatti belong to the higher tiers. \n\nThe game also has a detailed modification system. The player can customize not only the car's look but also its important details like tires and aerodynamics.\n\n###Tracks\nAs the player progresses, he or she may unlock new levels. Some of them are based on real-life tracks of Formula One fame, including Spa-Francorchamps, Nurburgring, Silverstone and Laguna Seca. Others are purely fictional and only exist in-game.", "publisher": "Electronic Arts", "developer": "Electronic Arts", "releaseDate": 20090915, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Need for Speed Shift.US.ULUS-10462.UMD.Good.jpg"], "score": 83}, {"name": "Need for Speed Undercover.EU.ULES-01145.UMD.Good", "filename": "Need for Speed Undercover.EU.ULES-01145.UMD.Good.cso", "size": "823.16 MiB", "date": "20100616", "iconUrl": "covers/Need for Speed Undercover.EU.ULES-01145.UMD.Good.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Need for Speed Undercover.EU.ULES-01145.UMD.Good.jpg", "matchedName": "Need For Speed Undercover", "category": ["Racing", "Arcade"], "description": "Need For Speed Undercover is a racing game and the twelfth installment in the twenty-four-title long series of the same name.\n\n###Gameplay \nAlmost every Need For Speed game features the same gameplay features, and Undercover is no different. There is an open world which is permitted to discover at any time in contrary with, for instance, Most Wanted, where the environment was zoned, and the locations opened as the story progressed.\nThe car collisions system has become more realistic compared to the previous parts of the game, but damage remained cosmetic only with no impact on performance. However, the car may be destroyed in Highway Battle — one of the game mods. \nThe title features some RPG elements — wheelman points, which grants the player access to bonus levels and car parts. \nThe police in the game are traced by the bar at the top of the screen varying between Busted and Evade modes. The capturing of the player results in the checkpoint restart.\n\n###Plot \nThe game's title suggests the protagonist role in the story — he is an undercover police agent given a task to infiltrate the group of street-racers to expose them to arrest.

It is considered one of the most hardcore installments of the series. Unlike many of its predecessors, it is oriented towards the actual driving simulation rather than arcade racing.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe creators of Shift aimed to realistically imitate the driving experience, making the game harder than an average NFS game. However, Shift automatically adjusts the difficulty depending on the player's experience and skills. Before the player enters the career, he or she has to complete a test drive at the famous Brands Hatch track to familiarize the game with his or her driving abilities. \n\n###Cars\nNeed for Speed: Shift offers a roster of more than 60 vehicles. As in most Need for Speed games, the player starts with a small amount of money and only a handful of available vehicles. To unlock and purchase better cars, the player has to win races. The cars in Need for Speed: Shift consists of four classes called \"tiers\". The lowest tier contains the cheapest and slowest cars, while supercars from manufacturers like Lamborghini and Bugatti belong to the higher tiers. \n\nThe game also has a detailed modification system. The player can customize not only the car's look but also its important details like tires and aerodynamics.\n\n###Tracks\nAs the player progresses, he or she may unlock new levels. Some of them are based on real-life tracks of Formula One fame, including Spa-Francorchamps, Nurburgring, Silverstone and Laguna Seca.

Prince escapes his tower, where he is kept protected by his father, and pursues a mysterious guiding light, which turns out to be Helem, a spirit of Time who promises to help the Prince defeat his enemy.

Boost and jump your way around the futuristic circus act The Wheel of Death to avoid and smash your way through the obstacles thrown your way!\nControls\nUse the arrow keys and space bar to navigate the main menu.\nThis game currently supports up to two players locally. The current control bindings for the players are:\nPlayer1Space barPlayer2Enter key\nHow To Play\nThe main objective is to get as many laps as possible without crashing or overheating your bike. The more laps you get the more varied and difficult the wheel of death becomes: new drones, traps and other obstacles will appear to try and destroy your bike with every new lap completed.\nBoosting\nEach player can boost around the wheel by pressing and holding their button on the keyboard. The longer you boost, the hotter the player's engine gets (indicated by the thermometer icon that is the same colour as the player's bike). If your engine gets too hot then the bike will explode. However the hotter the your engine, the faster the bike will go so balancing the temperature of the engine is the key to success.\nJumping\nPlayers can jump by tapping their respective key. Jumping can help to reach and smash flying drones which will go towards filling up your super boost metre. Jumping can also be used to move around the Wheel Of Death faster as well as avoiding obstacles and taking over other players, but be warned, jumping in certain areas of the wheel while at slow speeds can cause the bike to fall into the spikes in the centre, so it is best done when travelling at max speed.\nThe SUPER BOOST\nOnce a player has filled up their yellow boost metre, they can then perform a super boost. Super boosts are initiated when you boost and the bikes engine temperature is at 0. Super boosts make you invulnerable to all drones and traps, and crashing into other players can destroy their bikes! Be sure to watch out for others performing super boosts though because if two players super boosting collide then both bikes are destroyed.", "developer": "Maroon Seal", "releaseDate": 20200518}, {"name": "Splinter_Cell_Essentials_USA_PSP-DMU", "filename": "Splinter_Cell_Essentials_USA_PSP-DMU.iso", "size": "1.69 GiB", "date": "20231122", "iconUrl": "covers/Splinter_Cell_Essentials_USA_PSP-DMU.jpg", "matchedName": "Opposites - GGJ DMU", "description": "Opposites is about exploring a maze with 2 different players at the same time with opposite controls, you must try to get to the end to win whilst avoiding enemies, if you look at the enemies they will appear and attack you.\nThis was made during Global Game Jam where we had 42 hours to create a game following the theme: Duality", "developer": "I3randon5", "releaseDate": 20220130}, {"name": "SplitSecond.US.ULUS-10513.UMD.Good", "filename": "SplitSecond.US.ULUS-10513.UMD.Good.iso", "size": "1.51 GiB", "date": "20120413", "iconUrl": "covers/SplitSecond.US.ULUS-10513.UMD.Good.jpg", "matchedName": "Splitseconds", "description": "Please Download or use Fullscreen Mode (Keyboard Focus needs fixing)\n... and turn up your Speakers! :D\n---------------------------------------------------\nPush both Buttons to finish the Level.\nBut there is not enough time!!\nIf only you could split yourself!?\nSPLITSECONDS\nfeat.

Initially released for the PlayStation in November 2000 in Japan, an English version was later released in North America in September 2001. It was developed by members of Telnet Japan's \"Wolfteam\", who had previously worked on its predecessors Tales of Phantasia and Tales of Destiny. The game's producers gave it the characteristic genre name RPG of Eternity and Bonds (永遠と絆のRPG, Eien to kizuna no RPG). A port was released for the PlayStation Portable handheld in Japan in March 2005, and the PAL region in February 2006.\nThe game, set in the fantasy world of Inferia, follows the story of a young hunter named Reid Hershel and his friends, Farah and Keele, as they meet a mysterious girl who speaks an unknown language. Their subsequent quest to discover her origins leads them across a dimensional boundary to an entirely different realm known as Celestia, where they become involved in an age-old conflict between the two worlds.

Although the positive impact of this revolution is obvious, every coin has a flipside; for every beneficial device developed with these new materials, so too were advanced weapons and other implements of war. Thus, the land became mired with turmoil, and remains in such a state even now.\nEnter, the bracers: an organization established to serve as police and intermediaries alike, holding above all else the peace and safety of the lands under their jurisdiction. Whenever a citizen is in need of assistance, he or she may place a request at the local Bracer Guild -- and be it monster extermination, crime prevention or even peace talks among warring nations, the bracers will do whatever they can to resolve the matter cleanly and efficiently.\nSome matters require a gentler touch than others, however. When an orbalship transporting a legendary \"S-rank\" bracer named Cassius Bright suddenly goes missing, said bracer's daughter, Estelle, and adoptive son, Joshua, must join forces in search of him across the entire Kingdom of Liberl.\nAnd what they find along the way could change both of their lives forever...\nHailed as one of the largest, longest and most meticulously detailed turn-based JRPG series of all time, this first chapter in the ongoing Trails saga sets the stage for what's quickly become Ys developer Nihon Falcom's most popular and best-selling franchise in their entire 30+ year history.

The aim is to be the first one to win 500 points. There is also a variation of the game called Uno Rush, announced two years later than the original.\n\n###Gameplay \nThe rules and card design do not differ from the original. Four players are sitting across the table.\nEvery player can check out his points in the composite chart. The round proceeds clockwise, it is supported by the revolving arrows and sound effects. The deck consists of 108 cards, 25 of each color. When it’s a player’s turn to go, he has to match the top card in the discard pile based on color, number or symbol of the card. They are dealt automatically to each player. It lets one focus on the game itself rather than on the mechanics.   \n\n###Key Features \nThe main visual appearance is a red screen and slow music so that the game screen can set up the background. There is not much action in the setting as the main processes appear between the players. Just like the original, one can’t see the opponents’ decks, so their goal is to become the first one to gain points. The player can also change the appearance in different game versions. For example, in Partner Uno the player with partners sit across from each other; the Xbox Live Version supports the webcams, which makes the action more intense.

This mostly affects the name and witty banter your\nWorms dish out to each other.\n\nNo two maps are the same as the game randomly generates a near infinite\nnumber of landscapes in Quick Start, Create Game and Multiplayer modes.\nIf you're up for a good challenge, see if you can take what the computer\nAI can dish out in Challenge mode.\n\nThe destructible landscapes and physics of the game are such that you're\noften your own worst enemy. If you're not exact with your calculations\nand take wind speed into account, you may end up doing more damage to\nyourself than your opponent.\n\nLike other Worms titles, the presentation of the game is simple with\nsolid gameplay, especially when it comes weapon selection. The replay\nvalue of the game will depend on your competitive nature and if you have\nhuman rivals you like to square off against. There are not an\noverwhelming number of options, so the game feels pretty straightforward.\n\nBottom Line\nLike the others in the Worms series, Worms: Open\nWarfare delivers a quality turn-based combat experience. It doesn't have\na ton of options, but with the randomly generated landscapes and simple\ngameplay, it makes for a fun pastime on Nintendo DS.", "publisher": "THQ", "releaseDate": 20060314, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Worms Open Warfare 2.US.ULUS-10260.UMD.Good.jpg"]}, {"name": "WRC FIA World Rally Championship.US.ULUS-10093.UMD.Good", "filename": "WRC FIA World Rally Championship.US.ULUS-10093.UMD.Good.iso", "size": "1.23 GiB", "date": "20220825", "iconUrl": "covers/WRC FIA World Rally Championship.US.ULUS-10093.UMD.Good.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/WRC FIA World Rally Championship.US.ULUS-10093.UMD.Good.jpg", "matchedName": "WRC: FIA World Rally Championship (2006)", "category": ["Action"], "releaseDate": 20060418, "screenshots": ["screenshots/WRC FIA World Rally Championship.US.ULUS-10093.UMD.Good.jpg"]}, {"name": "WWE All Stars.US.ULUS-10544.UMD.Good", "filename": "WWE All Stars.US.ULUS-10544.UMD.Good.iso", "size": "1.49 GiB", "date": "20220825", "iconUrl": "covers/WWE All Stars.US.ULUS-10544.UMD.Good.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/WWE All Stars.US.ULUS-10544.UMD.Good.jpg", "matchedName": "WWE All Stars", "category": ["Arcade", "Fighting", "Sports"], "description": "WWE® All Stars™ delivers an all-new take on WWE® with fast, fun, fluid and furious arcade-style gameplay that takes WWE® action to the next level!

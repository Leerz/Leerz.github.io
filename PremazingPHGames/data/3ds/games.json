Slimes, the weakest of RPG enemies, have the ability to take over enemy units and fight!\n[Summary]\nThis is a strategic turn-based RPG, but it is Slimes that you control. Slimes can take over an enemy and control them in battle.\nFor example, a Slime can utilise archers, or use magic if they take over a magician. They can even bewilder an enemy with a bribe if they take over a merchant.\nIn addition there are various kinds of Slimes:\nSome of them can warp.\nSome of them can improve the abilities of the possessed enemy.\nAnd many more...\nEach stage poses key strategic questions. Which Slime will you use on each enemy? How will you take them over?\nFor example the element of a Slime is very important for a capture. This is a tough game, too, so you cannot win by charging in recklessly - tactics are vital.\nThe appearance of this game may be lighthearted, but a big challenge awaits!\n[STORY]\nThe world was about to be ruined.\nThe brutal humans arrived and almost took over the whole world.\nThey burnt the forest, polluting the water and the sky.\nThey were tyrannical, almost ruining the land.\nAnd they threatened the Slimes that offered little resistance; they did not have great power and merely waited for extinction.\nThen the Slimes realised they could take over the human bodies and use that strength against their enemies.\nThe Slime counterattack began.", "publisher": "CIRCLE Ent.", "developer": "Flyhigh Works", "releaseDate": 20141014, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Ambition of the Slimes.jpg"]}, {"name": "Angry Birds Star Wars", "size": "165.84 MiB", "fileCount": "1", "date": "20250102", "files": ["Angry Birds Star Wars.cia"], "iconUrl": "covers/Angry Birds Star Wars.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Angry Birds Star Wars.jpg", "matchedName": "Angry Birds Star Wars", "category": ["Arcade", "Puzzle"], "description": "JOIN THE ANGRY BIRDS IN THEIR BIGGEST ADVENTURE YET!\nA long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... a group of desperate rebel birds faced off against a galactic menace: the Empire’s evil Pigtroopers!\nRebel birds, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Imperial Pigs.

To help her cope with this move, her friend Ayumi has devised a seemingly innocent plan: the whole group will come together to perform a charm she found on the internet called “Sachiko Ever After,” which is supposed to bind all of its participants together as friends to the end.\nThis does not go as expected.\nFollowing an intense earthquake, the group awakens to find themselves separated and trapped in an alternate reality version of Heavenly Host Elementary, a tragedy-stricken institution that once stood on the site of their own school but was torn down long ago. Here, the vengeful spirits of elementary-aged children threaten their lives and their sanity, and the only hope of escape – much less survival – is to uncover the chilling details surrounding the murders of those trapped before them.\nCorpse Party is the original Windows edition of the cult classic horror game that gained a considerable fanbase when released on Sony’s PlayStation®Portable system in 2011. Beginning life as an independent RPG Maker adventure title in 1996, the gameplay was greatly refined and the story greatly expanded for this 2008 remake, featuring more characters, more detailed interactions, darker story elements, over 5,000 lines of voice-acting and dozens of shocking, gruesome endings. Players take control of nine main characters and several side characters who’ve been split up into groups of two or three and trapped in a run-down, otherworldly elementary school full of vengeful spirits, deadly mysteries and – of course – corpses. As they walk around examining objects and bodies in an atmospheric 2D environment, a horror tale spanning over 50 years begins to unfold, and player choices determine both how the story ends and who lives to see it through.KEY FEATURESHighly Detailed Retro-Style Graphics Used to Enhance Atmosphere\nModeled after the very first RPG Maker Corpse Party, the game’s 16-bit-style 2D visuals help create an intentional disconnect that sparks the imagination, leading the player to envision far worse things than even the most powerful next-gen system could display.\nAdventure-Style Gameplay Where Your Decisions Make All the Difference\nPlaying like a cross between a point-and-click adventure game and a classic JRPG sans battles, Corpse Party gives players the freedom to thoroughly explore every last corner of Heavenly Host Elementary School, significantly altering the course of the story and its final conclusion based on where the characters go and what they do.\nChapter-Based Storytelling with PC-Exclusive Content\nThe tale is told through five main chapters with multiple endings each and numerous scenes that differ from the game’s PSP™ system and Nintendo 3DS™ system counterparts. In addition, there are four bonus chapters, one of which is a PC-exclusive retelling of the “Tooth” story from Corpse Party: Book of Shadows, recreated with added content in classic Corpse Party adventure style.\nOriginal Japanese Voice Cast and Character Art plus Text Skip Feature\nOver 5,000 lines of spoken Japanese dialogue from the original indie voice cast complement the action, giving new spins on familiar characters for series veterans. In addition, the original PC-exclusive character art is fully intact, and dedicated players seeking every ending are given a speedy fast-forward function to make replays a breeze.\nThe Game That Started It All\nWhen first released in 2008, this title sparked a Corpse Party boom in Japan: remakes, sequels, spin-offs, fan games, manga, anime, a live-action drama series and more, as well as countless Corpse Party-inspired horror games created by other indie developers in the same style.

To help her cope with this move, her friend Ayumi has devised a seemingly innocent plan: the whole group will come together to perform a charm she found on the internet called “Sachiko Ever After,” which is supposed to bind all of its participants together as friends to the end.\nThis does not go as expected.\nFollowing an intense earthquake, the group awakens to find themselves separated and trapped in an alternate reality version of Heavenly Host Elementary, a tragedy-stricken institution that once stood on the site of their own school but was torn down long ago. Here, the vengeful spirits of elementary-aged children threaten their lives and their sanity, and the only hope of escape – much less survival – is to uncover the chilling details surrounding the murders of those trapped before them.\nCorpse Party is the original Windows edition of the cult classic horror game that gained a considerable fanbase when released on Sony’s PlayStation®Portable system in 2011. Beginning life as an independent RPG Maker adventure title in 1996, the gameplay was greatly refined and the story greatly expanded for this 2008 remake, featuring more characters, more detailed interactions, darker story elements, over 5,000 lines of voice-acting and dozens of shocking, gruesome endings. Players take control of nine main characters and several side characters who’ve been split up into groups of two or three and trapped in a run-down, otherworldly elementary school full of vengeful spirits, deadly mysteries and – of course – corpses. As they walk around examining objects and bodies in an atmospheric 2D environment, a horror tale spanning over 50 years begins to unfold, and player choices determine both how the story ends and who lives to see it through.KEY FEATURESHighly Detailed Retro-Style Graphics Used to Enhance Atmosphere\nModeled after the very first RPG Maker Corpse Party, the game’s 16-bit-style 2D visuals help create an intentional disconnect that sparks the imagination, leading the player to envision far worse things than even the most powerful next-gen system could display.\nAdventure-Style Gameplay Where Your Decisions Make All the Difference\nPlaying like a cross between a point-and-click adventure game and a classic JRPG sans battles, Corpse Party gives players the freedom to thoroughly explore every last corner of Heavenly Host Elementary School, significantly altering the course of the story and its final conclusion based on where the characters go and what they do.\nChapter-Based Storytelling with PC-Exclusive Content\nThe tale is told through five main chapters with multiple endings each and numerous scenes that differ from the game’s PSP™ system and Nintendo 3DS™ system counterparts. In addition, there are four bonus chapters, one of which is a PC-exclusive retelling of the “Tooth” story from Corpse Party: Book of Shadows, recreated with added content in classic Corpse Party adventure style.\nOriginal Japanese Voice Cast and Character Art plus Text Skip Feature\nOver 5,000 lines of spoken Japanese dialogue from the original indie voice cast complement the action, giving new spins on familiar characters for series veterans. In addition, the original PC-exclusive character art is fully intact, and dedicated players seeking every ending are given a speedy fast-forward function to make replays a breeze.\nThe Game That Started It All\nWhen first released in 2008, this title sparked a Corpse Party boom in Japan: remakes, sequels, spin-offs, fan games, manga, anime, a live-action drama series and more, as well as countless Corpse Party-inspired horror games created by other indie developers in the same style.

The second installment in The Legend of Zelda series, it was developed and published by Nintendo for the Family Computer Disk System on January 14, 1987, less than a year after the original The Legend of Zelda was released and seven months before North America saw the release of the first Zelda title. The game was released in North America and the PAL region for the Nintendo Entertainment System in late 1988, almost two years after its initial release in Japan.\nThe Adventure of Link is a direct sequel to the original The Legend of Zelda, again involving the protagonist, Link, on a quest to save Princess Zelda, who has fallen under a sleeping spell. The Adventure of Link's emphasis on side-scrolling and role-playing elements, however, was a significant departure from its predecessor. As of 2016, the game remains the only technical sequel to the original title, as all other entries in the series either are prequels or take place in an alternative reality, according to the official Zelda timeline.\nThe game was a critical and financial success, and introduced elements such as Link's \"magic meter\" and the Dark Link character that would become commonplace in future Zelda games, although the role-playing elements, such as experience points, and the platform-style side-scrolling and limited lives have not been used since in canonical games.

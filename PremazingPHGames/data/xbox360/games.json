When trying to influence this computer, MIA fell under the influence of Klein's intellect and now cannot help Theodor.\n\nKlein tells Theodor that the ship was not really created by aliens, but by the inhabitants of Earth and is a huge scientific station, where earthlings explored alien beings.\n\nAlien Breed 3: Descent\n\nTheodor's situation becomes even more complex. Now the only one with whom Theodor can communicate is Klein's intellect, loaded into a computer. However, this is quite a developed \"creature\" that fully controls the ship, or rather, the scientific station, along with all the aliens on it. And this intelligence is able not only to control the aliens, but also to modify them.\n\nAs it turned out, Klein is able to send against Theodor his last ally MIA - MIA did not die, but turned into a fully manipulated Klein artificial intelligence, opposed to Theodor. However, Theodor manages to win over her and she even tells him how to defeat Klein. This is not easy, because Klein directs against Theodor all the systems of a huge ship.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe gameplay has common features in all three games of the series.\n\nAll games are shooters, the action of which takes place in the futuristic interiors of space ships.\n\nEach level contains several tasks, such as finding keys or restoring ship systems to work.\n\nBefore leaving the level, the player must complete all tasks.\n\nOpponents are aliens.\n\nInterestingly, you can save the game only in special places.

A major conspiracy is revealed by the player after fixing the servers.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe players can explore the northern part of North America - a frozen seashore of the Atlantic, the territory of the Apache, the Valley of Rivers, and New York, that got remade with respect to the real city of the eighteenth century. \n\nThe game features the same ship sailing mechanics as features in Assassin's Creed IV. It is essential for Shay to escape the Assassins he will encounter, minimize the casualties of his sailors, and destroy enemy ships. Shay's ship named \"Morrigan\" is well-adapted for sailing through the ice and the seas of the Atlantic. It is equipped with barrels of oil and Puckle guns.\n\nIn his inventory, Shay has several swords, an air gun, a pistol, and several grenades.

Developers became studio Liquid Entertainment, and the publisher company Codemasters. The game appeared on the PC and on the most popular consoles of its generation: Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.\n\n###The story and the setting\nThe plot of the game tells about Jason, and the action takes place in Ancient Greece. Like God of War, the game uses ancient Greek mythology to build a game universe. The modified myth of Jason and the Argonauts, who went on a journey for the Golden Fleece was used as inspiration. According to the scriptwriters of the game, Jason is a Greek king, whose wife was killed in front of him. The only way for a grieving husband to return the beloved is the Golden Fleece, which can resurrect the dead. Other well-known heroes of myths appear in the game: Hercules, Achilles, Medea, Medusa, Patroclus, and others. Together they travel through a variety of real and imaginary locations: Iolcu, Delphi, Mycenae, Tartar, and Kifr.\n\n###Key features\nThe game consists of a large number of dialogues and enemies confrontations on vast, detailed levels. In contrast to God of War, critics point out simple battles with bosses and the strange arrangement of enemies on each level, which also simplifies the gameplay. You can use a sword as a weapon, a spear, and a mace is also available. Each weapon has its own characteristics and offers different gameplay: the mace breaks shields, but can not cope with a large number of enemies, the sword reduces the player's defense capabilities, but increases the effectiveness of melee combat, etc. In addition to these weapons, you can upgrade Jason skills on four branches: Ares, Hermes, Apollo, and Athena.

But there is a clarification - this is a dead policeman, killed because of his work, but he did not leave the world, he turned into a ghost and did not lose his passion for investigations.\nA hero can do many things in our world, but not all. Can be present everywhere and even pass through the walls (but not in closed houses, only through open doors and windows). Can see what ordinary people see, read, think. But he can not take and move things, cannot talk with living people - for actions with objects and communication he has to find a girl-medium.\nIn the game, you need to collect evidence and draw conclusions from this.

However, to accomplish his conquest and become a truly powerful and feared dark lord, you will have to commit some really vile deeds. One of your first missions, for example, involves slaughtering baby seals.\nThe game follows the Overlord from his childhood, as he grows from a nasty kid to a mighty dark knight that looks a lot like Sauron as shown in The Fellowship of the Ring movie. The Overlord begins his conquest with a pack of goblins and a single troll, but over time his minions will develop into more powerful and deadly creatures and attack the enemy in large hordes. The game does not turn into a strategy, however, as you still only directly control the dark lord himself, and the minions are commanded through his orders.  Overlord II is famous for its humor: the game does not take itself too seriously.

Besides dots, the player can collect bonus items that give additional points, and power pellets that allow Pac-Man to eat ghosts.

If the level of happiness is low, the people can go to the rebels. And when the rebels accumulate a lot, they attack various objects, including the Palace. Undermining the Palace means defeat in the game, so in case of a low level of happiness, a vast army has to suppress the riots. But the military, in turn, must also be happy with life.

Since its initial release in 2012, it has received two free extensions, Skullgirls Encore and Skullgirls 2nd Encore and while its roster initially consisted of an all-female cast of 8 characters, 6 more characters were added, 5 being developed thanks to the game's Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, including 2 male characters. At its release, Skullgirls was developed by Reverge Labs, but the team that created the game split off from the company to form Lab Zero. In Japan, the game is published by Arc System Works. On Nintendo Switch, the game is published by Skybound Games.\n\nSkullgirls takes place in the Canopy Kingdom, inspired by 1940s America, in which corruption and conflict runs rampant. Once every seven years, an artifact called the Skull Heart appears, granting the wish of one woman. However, if the Skull Heart is used by a woman with impure intentions, it will control her, turning her into a destructive monster called the Skullgirl. Not once has anyone used the Skull Heart without falling to its curse. The game follows the stories of 14 characters on their way to face the Skullgirl and retrieve the Heart, be it for the greater good or simply their own gain.\n\nThe game is a tribute to Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and its mechanics are intended as a more polished version of the classic fighting game title, with some original ideas. In a standard player vs. player match, each player controls one character out a chosen number of one to three characters which they can switch to at any time. They can also call their inactive characters to perform assist attacks. Like most Marvel vs. Capcom-inspired games, Skullgirls is fast-paced and features long, complex combos based on animation cancels. It introduces a burst system which allows players to break their opponent's combo if it becomes too long.\n\nSkullgirls features a 'dark deco'-inspired art style mixed with some horror themes and a jazz and rock soundtrack consisting of 28 tracks. In 2013, the game set the Guinness World Record Gamer's Edition record for most average frames of animation per character in a video game, reaching 1,439 frames per character and 11,515 frames total for its initial eight-character roster.\n\nIn February 2013, Skullgirls came in second in a crowdfunding event organized by fighting game website Shoryuken to decide what would be the final game featured on the EVO 2013 line up, with all proceeds sent to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.

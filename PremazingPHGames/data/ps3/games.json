It was eventually released as a standalone spin-off game with only minor connections to the main plot of Gothic.\n\n###Plot\nRhobar III, the king of Myrtana and the former protagonist of the Gothic trilogy, sent his army to conquer the Southern Islands. It seems that the king is possessed by an evil force. The protagonist is a young man from the island of Feshyr. As he prepares to marry, Rhobar's army invades the island, killing the protagonist's family. Now he's to become the new Nameless Hero like Rhobar once was. His goal is to avenge his family and to save the world from the madness of the king. \n\n###Setting\nThe game is set in a high fantasy universe. The world is open, however, it is divided into several regions, each of them serving as an open world in itself. To unlock a new region, the protagonist has to complete certain quests for NPCs that unlock new regions. \n\n###Gameplay\nDespite not being the proper part of Gothic series, the game shows a strong similarity to the original trilogy. It is a 3D third-person RPG with a strong emphasis on action. Some of the game's mechanics became simpler. The creators scrapped most spells from the previous games, leaving only three (fire, ice, and lightning), although they can be upgraded. There are three character classes: Warrior, Mage, or Ranger. The protagonist levels up automatically, but to distribute his XP to certain skill is up to the player.

The previous titles were mostly focused on multiplayer with large numbers of players.\n\nThe game is retaining the vehicular and large-scale warfare but emphasizes squad-based combat.\n\n###The First Russo-American War and the private campaign of Bad Company\nSerdaristan, a small Caucasian country, became a place for a big war between Russia and the United States. First in Serdaristan, then in the Middle East, in the town of Sadiz on the coast of the Caspian Sea, the 222th Battalion, also known as the \"Bad Company\", puts itself under bullets. The name \"Bad Company\" is not accidental - the detachment consists of people who are best able to deliver problems.\n\nOne of the columns of the Bad Company was destroyed when it was sent to the battlefield. In investigating this case, the Bad Company's soldiers find out that they are not opposed by the Russian army, but mercenaries to whom Russia pays gold. Since then, the Bad Company has been fighting not only for the victory and glory of its country, but also for the sake of gold, which can be obtained in the pockets of defeated opponents.\n\n###The Newby and the Team\nPreston Marlowe is the main protagonist of the game. He just came to the Bad Company - just before the Bad Company found a new goal for itself - gold.\n\nSergeant Samuel D. Redford is the commander of the Bad Company and the only one who came there as a volunteer. He just likes to fight.\n\nGeorge Gordon Haggard, Jr. - has an explosive nature. And he knows everything about explosives.\nTerrence Sweetwater - smart ass.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player acts with one main weapon and another, used in the second turn. In addition to this, there are grenades, a knife and portable explosive devices. The player always has information about the number of remaining ammunition. If vehicles are not completely destroyed, they can be repaired any number of times. \n\nMilitary vehicles in the game are sufficient: infantry fighting vehicles, armored cars, tanks, attack helicopters, patrol boats, mobile anti-aircraft weapon system.\n\nFor the first time in the Battlefield games line, the Frostbite game engine is used - 90% of the environment can be destroyed. Destruction is subject to almost everything: trees, grass and bushes, vehicles, other players and even the ground itself. Lighting is adjusted for changes caused by destruction.\n\n###More and more\nGold Edition\nThe main feature of this edition is that it immediately makes available those types of weapons that are usually unlocked after reaching level 25.\n\nFind All Five\nThis addition allows you to unlock five types of weapons that are not available in the main game - the F2000 machine, the USAS-12 automatic shotgun, the M60 machine gun, the QBU-88 sniper rifle and the Uzi submachine gun with the silencer.

You decide the combat role you want to assume in the world of Brink as you fight to save yourself and mankind’s last refuge. Brink offers a compelling mix of dynamic battlefields, extensive customization options, and an innovative control system that will keep you coming back for more.\nBrink takes place on the Ark, a man-made floating city that is on the brink of all-out civil war. Originally built as an experimental, self-sufficient and 100% “green” habitat, the reported rapid rise of the Earth’s oceans has forced the Ark to become home to not only the original founders and their descendants but also to thousands of refugees. With tensions between the two groups growing, Security and Resistance forces are locked in a heated battle for control of the Ark. Which side will you choose?\n\nKEY FEATURES:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNot Just Another Hero – Brink's advanced player customization offers a near-endless combination of looks for your character – allowing for the appearance of your character to be truly unique.  As you progress through the game and acquire more experience, you’ll have even more opportunities for customization.\nTwo Sides to Every Story – Choose to fight through the single player campaign as either a member of the Resistance or the Security and then take your same character online to play cooperatively or competitively against other players.\nBlurring the Lines – Take your unique character online at any time you choose!  Brink allows you to seamlessly move between your single player campaign, co-op with friends, and intense multiplayer action. Multiplayer takes the story online where you can play with up to seven other people (or AI characters) cooperatively as you take on the opposing faction or with up to 16 players competitively.\nPlay SMART – Brink uses the familiar shooter controls that you’re used to, without frustrating, artificial constraints and adds a new feature: the SMART button.  When you press the SMART button, the game dynamically evaluates where you’re trying to get to, and makes it happen. Whether you’re a seasoned FPS veteran or someone just getting started, you’ll be able to make more intelligent decisions during the fast-paced action with SMART.\nContext-Sensitive Goals and Rewards - Objectives, communications, missions, and inventory selection are all dynamically generated based on your role, your condition, your location, your squad-mates, and the overall status of the battle in all gameplay modes.

It is also 39th part of the vast Castlevania series. The game currently features no successors.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game, unlike its predecessor, features an open-world structure. The player follows the adventures of Gabriel Belmont through medieval settings and modern environments. Sometimes — at the start of the story, to be precise — the players gain control of Dracula who possesses Gabriel and gives him similar powers. The game consists of many fighting sequences in which combos are of importance — the various swords and claws, some allowing the protagonist to replenish his health and the other dealing massive damage to the enemies.\n\n###Story\nThe game is highly story-driven. At the start, the developers present the players with the scenes of flashbacks, in which the transformation to Dracula is shown. While set in medieval settings, events depict Dracula as he quickly gets ambushed by his resurrected son and thrown back into the modern times where he starts his adventures.\n\n###DLC\nThe Revelations DLC released a month after the initial game announcement brings some story arc to the game, while the others: \"Dark Dracula\" and \"Armored Dracula\" bring only new characters skins and sprites.", "publisher": "Konami", "developer": "Mercury Steam Entertainment", "releaseDate": 20140221, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2 - [BLUS30999].jpg"], "score": 58}, {"name": "Castlevania Lords of Shadow BLES01047", "filename": "Castlevania Lords of Shadow BLES01047.iso", "size": "11.97 GiB", "date": "20240718", "iconUrl": "covers/Castlevania Lords of Shadow BLES01047.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Castlevania Lords of Shadow BLES01047.jpg", "matchedName": "Castlevania: Lords of Shadow", "category": ["Adventure", "Action"], "description": "Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is a slasher game developed by MercurySteam. It is a reboot of the Castlevania game series.\n\n###Plot\nThe game takes place in a fantasy version of a middle age Europe. A member of the group of knights, calling themselves the Brotherhood of Light, defends common people from supernatural creatures. His wife was murdered by one of them, but her soul is trapped between the worlds. She comes back to her husband Gabriel and guides him to the God Masks that can bring her back to life.\n\n###Gameplay\nCastlevania: Lords of Shadow is a third-person adventure slasher title. Like in most games of this genre, Lords of Shadow focuses on short-range combat. The main weapon the player has is a chain whip called the Combat Cross. The players can use its powerful direct attacks or weak attacks that can be performed to inflict damage in a big radius. These attacks can be chained into more than forty different combo attacks.\n\nThe game features a Light and Shadow magic system, which affects the characteristics of the spells used by the player. Should one go on the path of Light, defensive spells will be used with Shadow magic using aggressive ones. It is also possible to upgrade the player's whip.\n\nJust like the previous Castlevania titles, the game features numerous puzzles and a certain degree of platforming. The Combat Cross can be used by the player to scale walls, rappel down them or swing across the pits.", "publisher": "Konami", "developer": "Konami Digital Entertainment", "releaseDate": 20101005, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Castlevania Lords of Shadow BLES01047.jpg"], "score": 84}, {"name": "Catherine BLUS30428", "filename": "Catherine BLUS30428.iso", "size": "10.12 GiB", "date": "20240713", "iconUrl": "covers/Catherine BLUS30428.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Catherine BLUS30428.jpg", "matchedName": "Catherine", "category": ["Adventure", "Action", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "description": "Catherine is a platformer/visual novel developed by Atlus for PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2011.\r\n\r\n###Plot\r\nThe plot follows the adventures of Vincent Brooks, who is choosing between the two girlfriends — Katerine and Catherine with the opposite personalities. While making relationship choices throughout the daytime, Vinet is forced to participate in realistic nightmares at night. The setting of a title is two narratives folded one into another: on the outer layer, the game has TV-Show \"The Midnight Versus\" which tells the story of an inner layer — the adventures of \"Catherine\" world.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nThe gaming process consists of two stages, according to the protagonist's activities. While the ventures during the day resemble the usual visual novel mechanics: walking, listening to dialogues and watching cinematics pieces, the action gameplay reveals itself in the night. There Vincent has to climb a set of stairs by removing and climbing blocks to avoid traps. If he fails — the protagonist dies in real life.\r\n\r\n###Reception\r\nThe game journalists generally liked the game but were disappointed by the sexists and misogynistic stories found within it.

The game consists of 6 non-related cases.\nThe first accentuation in levels is made in investigating the crime scene and searching for clues.

Frank enters the city by helicopter, the helicopter pilot is told to return to Frank in 72 hours. Frank quickly finds himself in a shopping center, where a crowd of people are trying to hide from the zombies - as it turns out, it was zombies that caused the closure of the city.\n\nOver the next 72 hours (this time is one of the strict conditions of the game), Frank must survive, save a few people and understand where the zombies came from. Along the way, he fights with zombies, seeks solutions, makes weapons and takes photographs - he is still a photojournalist. For successful shots, he gets more experience, which is appreciated in the game.\n\n###Wheelchair with machine guns\nThe second game \"forgets\" about Frank, it features a motorcyclist Chuck Green, who arrives in Willamet after all has settled down. There is a drug against turning into a zombie now, it is expensive, but effective. However, the new invasion of the zombie is still happening, Chuck drives around the town on a wheelchair with a pair of rifles, shooting hordes of zombies and simultaneously showing a touching concern for his daughter, who is somewhere nearby and needs a cure for zombification.\n\n###Zombies give a second chance\nThe third game \"resurrects\" Frank, who after success in the first game managed to fall to the bottom of life. In search of a new chance to succeed, Frank returns to Willameth, who seems to have been cleared of zombies twice, but Frank is very lucky - zombies capture the city for the third time. This time there are more enemies, among them many new ones. There are also more types of weapons - those that you need to do yourself from improvised means. Frank will visit places in the city that he did not suspect.

It renders the F1 racers as wacky characters and their cars as karts.\n\n###Style\nThe game features drivers, teams, and races from the 2012 season of Formula One. However, unlike most simulators, which aim to represent the races realistically, F1 Race Stars is a humorous arcade game. The racers, such as Sebastian Vettel, Michael Schumacher, Fernando Alonso, and Lewis Hamilton, are depicted as cartoonish versions of themselves. \n\n###Tracks\nThere's a total of eleven tracks based on the real Formula One circuits. They retained their basic configurations but were enhanced with springboards, loops, traps, and other unrealistic features. The circuits' backgrounds also became comical representations of a country where the race is set in.\n\n###Gameplay\nAlthough the game is a kart simulation, F1 Race Stars doesn't imitate the actual karting, either. It provides a fictional combination of karting and Formula driving experiences. The cars in the game cannot drift and slide. Instead, the game uses the real-world KERS system to give the car a boost when exiting the corner. The game features power-up in the vein of Super Mario Kart, and some of them are parodies of the actual Formula One elements, such as a safety car.

Rebellious clone soldiers are capable of even cannibalism, and other details of the setting correspond to this level of fear.\nProtagonists and antagonists have unusual abilities or conventional abilities, developed to an unusually high level. This is manifested, among other things, in the possession of ghostly forms, by which it is possible to mislead other people.\n\nThe game is strictly from the first person. A notable feature of the gameplay is the slow motion mode. In this mode, the player accelerates the perception to such an extent that it can see the flying bullets. This gives him obvious advantages. The slow motion mode, in the game, is explained by the increased content of adrenaline in the blood, which occurs in a person, in a situation that threatens life. If this condition is caused in a natural way, then it does not last long. It can be extended with the help of a special drug, which is included in the number of useful game stuff.

One may customize their vehicle in five parameters each corresponding to the different characteristics and choose out of four classes of cars to play with. \n\n###Special edition\nThere are two versions of the game: standard and special edition.

This allowed smoothly change the music themes of locations and creating a more immersive experience for players. The game was reissued in July 2010. The new version included the classic visuals of the original game: you can simply switch to it via a menu. The original version was completed with new features such as all the dialogues were voiced, developers added achievements and comments from leading developers. In the game, as before, there are two difficulty modes: normal and light, for players who have not played quests before and are not ready for difficult puzzles.\n\n###The story\nThe plot of the second part begins with the story of the main character Guybrush Tripwood telling to two other pirates about the victory over LeChuck in the last game. The pirates noticed that they have heard this story a thousand times already and asked Guybrush to tell something new. The hero shares that the events of the new chapter of his adventures are unfolding right now: he is looking for the legendary pirate treasure of Big Whoop.\n\n###Key features\nThe game is a classic point-and-click adventure. The player moves through the pre-drawn locations, and all the animated actions occur in the pop-up window. A new part of the Guybrush adventures was highly anticipated: the game was even called the most anticipated in 1992.

As your reputation grows, you'll attract the attention of ever more distinguished sponsors, who'll ask you to achieve ever more difficult objectives.\nPhysics and A.I.\nThe new riding model means bike behavior is even closer to actual race prototypes, resulting in a more immersive and authentic experience. Improved tire simulation, combined with the new bike physics, guarantees you an even more precise and exciting riding experience. Rider and bike now enjoy an improved symbiosis: every dip in the track, every time the rider brakes hard, every time the bike starts to drift, the rider reacts with dedicated animations.\nImproved artificial intelligence guarantees a greater and more realistic challenge: your rivals are now more decisive and effective when overtaking, they make more mistakes pushing the limits, and their times are closer to those of their real-life counterparts.\nBeat the Time\nWith the new Beat The Time mode you can put your skills to the test by riding round a circuit and trying to beat the record set by the champions of each class, riding the same bike they were riding, with the same set-up. Have you got what it takes to beat the best on equal terms?GAME FEATURESOffline Game Modes\nPut yourself to the test riding in a variety of different game modes: hit the track straight away with an Instant Race, customize the event and your bike to race in Grand Prix mode, or participate in all 18 Grand Prix by racing in the Championship. Set track records playing Time Attack, and relive the most spectacular moments of the MotoGP™ 2014 championship with Real Events, or take on challenges from the past in the 2-Stroke Events mode.\nOnline Game Modes\nWith online play for up to 12 players, you can challenge your friends in Grand Prix and Championship modes. Try the Split Time mode, where only the most consistent rider will have a chance of winning: beat your rivals' sector split times over as many laps as possible!\nYou can also climb the international leaderboards to become champion of the MotoGP™ Sprint Season, a series of races where the challenge level increases with each new race.\nRoster\nThe complete official roster of the 2015 Motorcycle World Championship awaits you! The game features all the riders and teams of the MotoGP™, Moto2™, and Moto3™ categories from 2015 and 2014. They are joined by legends from the past, from Wayne Gardner on his NSR 500 to Noriyuki Haga on his YZR500: can you tame these bikes with their two-stroke engines and no electronics?\nTrack list\nIn MotoGP™15 you can race on all 18 official tracks from the 2015 championship.\nLosail International Circuit\nCircuit of the Americas\nTermas de Río Hondo\nCircuito de Jerez\nLe Mans\nAutodromo del Mugello\nBarcelona-Catalunya\nTT Assen\nSachsenring\nIndianapolis Motor Speedway\nAutomotodrom Brno\nSilverstone Circuit\nMisano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli\nMotorLand Aragón\nTwin Ring Motegi\nPhillip Island\nSepang International Circuit\nComunitat Valenciana - Ricardo Tormo", "publisher": "BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment US", "developer": "BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America", "releaseDate": 20150623, "screenshots": ["screenshots/MotoGP 15 [BLES02162].jpg"], "score": 2.91}, {"name": "Motor Storm Apocalypse BCES00484", "filename": "Motor Storm Apocalypse BCES00484.iso", "size": "18.78 GiB", "date": "20240716", "iconUrl": "covers/Motor Storm Apocalypse BCES00484.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Motor Storm Apocalypse BCES00484.jpg", "matchedName": "Storm", "category": ["Indie", "Simulation", "Puzzle"], "description": "Take a deep breath and prepare for a tranquil journey through the seasons with Storm, an atmospheric, ethereal experience where you use natural phenomena to guide a simple seed to fertile soil so it can take root and spring to life.\nEmbrace the subtleties and strengths of nature to move a broken branch, fill a small pond or make snow fall to solve puzzles and create natural paths.

After defeating GladOS at the end of the first game but failing to escape the facility, Chell is woken up from a stasis chamber by an AI personality core, Wheatley, as the unkempt complex is falling apart. As the two attempt to navigate through the ruins and escape, they stumble upon GladOS, and accidentally re-activate her...\n\nPortal 2's core mechanics are very similar to the first game's ; the player must make their way through several test chambers which involve puzzles. For this purpose, they possess a Portal Gun, a weapon capable of creating teleportation portals on white surfaces. This seemingly simple mechanic and its subtleties coupled with the many different puzzle elements that can appear in puzzles allows the game to be easy to start playing, yet still feature profound gameplay.

Upon the Prince's arrival, the kingdom is found to be under a siege. Trying to repel the invaders, Malik uses an ancient mystic medallion that frees the ancient army of Solomon. Upon breaking free, the army turns the people of the kingdom into sand statues.

The game features a complex fighting system. \r\n\r\nAs the game progresses, the Prince learns more and more skills. The player is able to control all four nature elements: fire, earth, water, and air. Using such power, it is easy to manipulate the game's environment.

Experimentation reveals some great new items!\nThrough Alchemy: Alchemy allows you to combine several items to create a single, more powerful piece of equipment. While you lose the items used in the alchemy, you gain a powerful new piece of equipment and permanent access to your new item in the Shop! Alchemy can create powerful new weapons and armour but occasionally a Smithing Accident will occur and the smith will create a different item than what you expected!\nThe \"Soul Breed\" system\nAgarest takes place across 5 generations of heroes, starting with your first character, Leonhardt. During each generation you will build relationships with 3 different female party members, and at the end of each generation's story arc you must choose to marry one of the girls.\nYour choice of marriage partner is restricted to girls who've grown fond of you over a particular generation. Your options are determined by your choices during conversations at certain points of the story.\nThe girl you choose as your wife - and the strength of their relationship with you - will determine the abilities of the main character in the next generation of the story.

Nathan Hale wanders somewhere in a snowy forest after the destruction of an alien tower in London. Suddenly, a black ops squad finds him. They put their guns up on the protagonist and demand that Hale goes with them. At first, Nathan wants to blow himself and all the soldiers up with a grenade, but changes his mind and complies.

Many weapons from Fall of Man were reused, with several new additions such as the Marksman and a minigun. The game is based in the 1960s, so the weapons resemble a mix between the common weaponry of the time and advanced alien tech. Unlike the first game, the players can only carry two weapons at all times. \n\nResistance 2 goes away from the health bar system in favor of regenerative health.

Developers became studio Liquid Entertainment, and the publisher company Codemasters. The game appeared on the PC and on the most popular consoles of its generation: Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.\n\n###The story and the setting\nThe plot of the game tells about Jason, and the action takes place in Ancient Greece. Like God of War, the game uses ancient Greek mythology to build a game universe. The modified myth of Jason and the Argonauts, who went on a journey for the Golden Fleece was used as inspiration. According to the scriptwriters of the game, Jason is a Greek king, whose wife was killed in front of him. The only way for a grieving husband to return the beloved is the Golden Fleece, which can resurrect the dead. Other well-known heroes of myths appear in the game: Hercules, Achilles, Medea, Medusa, Patroclus, and others. Together they travel through a variety of real and imaginary locations: Iolcu, Delphi, Mycenae, Tartar, and Kifr.\n\n###Key features\nThe game consists of a large number of dialogues and enemies confrontations on vast, detailed levels. In contrast to God of War, critics point out simple battles with bosses and the strange arrangement of enemies on each level, which also simplifies the gameplay. You can use a sword as a weapon, a spear, and a mace is also available. Each weapon has its own characteristics and offers different gameplay: the mace breaks shields, but can not cope with a large number of enemies, the sword reduces the player's defense capabilities, but increases the effectiveness of melee combat, etc. In addition to these weapons, you can upgrade Jason skills on four branches: Ares, Hermes, Apollo, and Athena.

Worse than that, the T Energy itself went out of control, turning negative and creating destructive evil in the land. The nobility as well as the clerical caste of the High Elves struggled to seize power over the high-elvish imperium, so that they alone might hold the T Power in their rule.

Another surge damages the crew’s helicopter; Nathaniel is the only person who stays alive. He fades out to find himself in the past.

In Sniper: Ghost Warrior, the player assumes the roles of several main characters, among them a US soldier Tyler Wells who performs sniping and stealth operations, and a local rebel El Tejon who is most useful in open combat.\n\n###Gameplay\nThere are several types of missions in the game. Some of them emphasize stealth action and marksmanship, while others involve direct firefight. Besides a variety of sniper rifles, the characters can use other silent weapons, such as knives and silenced handguns.\n\nThe game has a quasi-realistic model of bullet ballistics. The player has to take into account the distance to the target and the bullet's flight time. The wind and the shooter's physical condition also influence the accuracy. In lower difficulty levels, the player can use the system that indicates the designated target and the place of the actual hit.", "publisher": "CI Games", "developer": "City Interactive", "releaseDate": 20100624, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Sniper Ghost Warrior BLES01286.jpg"], "score": 55}, {"name": "Snipers Invisible Silent Deadly BLES01327", "filename": "Snipers Invisible Silent Deadly BLES01327.iso", "size": "726.97 MiB", "date": "20240717", "iconUrl": "covers/Snipers Invisible Silent Deadly BLES01327.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Snipers Invisible Silent Deadly BLES01327.jpg", "matchedName": "Silent Hill Homecoming", "category": ["Adventure", "Action"], "description": "In Silent Hill Homecoming, Alex Shepherd has returned to his hometown of Shepherd's Glen to investigate the sudden disappearance of his brother.

The S.I.N corporation begins a new tournament for the best fighters from all over the world. Although each participant has its reason to take part in the tournament, the S.I.N’s motivation behind it is to collect necessary data from fighters to complete a bio-weapon project BLECE.  \n\n###Gameplay \nLike most other games in series, Street Fighter IV is a 2D fighting with one-on-one fights between various characters with unique fighting styles and supernatural abilities. The core gameplay is very reminiscent to that of the Street Fighter II, but the game adds many new mechanics, gameplay elements as well as new characters, stages, game modes. The two main gameplay innovations in SFIV are Focus Attacks and Ultra Combos. Focus Attacks are chargeable attacks that can knock down an opponent. It can also absorb one opponent’s strike which gives a new layer to the game combat and makes gameplay less combo-based and more focused on reading the opponent’s moves and fast reactions. Super Combo gauge returns for previous games and allows the player to perform more powerful versions of character’s special attacks. The new Ultra Combo system fills a special Ultra Combo gauge with each hit laid on your character and allows you to unleash a string of powerful attacks on the enemy.", "publisher": "Capcom", "developer": "Capcom", "releaseDate": 20090212, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Super Street Fighter IV - Arcade Edition (USA) (En,Ja,Fr,De,Es,It,Ko).jpg"], "score": 91}, {"name": "Supercar Challenge BLES00581", "filename": "Supercar Challenge BLES00581.iso", "size": "3.14 GiB", "date": "20240717", "iconUrl": "covers/Supercar Challenge BLES00581.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Supercar Challenge BLES00581.jpg", "matchedName": "SuperCar Challenge", "category": ["Racing", "Simulation"], "publisher": "System 3", "developer": "Eutechnyx", "releaseDate": 20090904, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Supercar Challenge BLES00581.jpg"]}, {"name": "Superstars V8 Racing BLES00529", "filename": "Superstars V8 Racing BLES00529.iso", "size": "2.06 GiB", "date": "20240717", "iconUrl": "covers/Superstars V8 Racing BLES00529.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Superstars V8 Racing BLES00529.jpg", "matchedName": "Superstars V8: Next Challenge", "category": ["Racing", "Arcade"], "description": "A touring car style racing game with Real-world V8 cars from BMW, Jaguar, Cadillac, Porsche, Maserati and more .

It can also absorb one opponent’s strike which gives a new layer to the game combat and makes gameplay less combo-based and more focused on reading the opponent’s moves and fast reactions.

It is the sequel to Virtua Fighter and the second game in the Virtua Fighter series. It was created by Sega's Yu Suzuki-headed AM2 and was released in the arcade in 1994. It was ported to the Sega Saturn in 1995 and Microsoft Windows in 1997. In 1996, a super deformed version of the game, Virtua Fighter Kids, arrived in arcades and was ported to the Sega Saturn. A 2D remake was released for the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1996. In addition, Virtua Fighter 2 was converted for the PlayStation 2 in 2004 as part of Sega's Ages 2500 series in Japan. The Mega Drive/Genesis port was re-released on the PS2 and PSP in 2006 as part of Sega Genesis Collection, on the Virtual Console for the Wii on March 20, 2007 (Japan) and April 16, 2007 (North America), and for iOS on January 20, 2011.\nVirtua Fighter 2 was known for its breakthrough graphics. It used Sega's Model 2 arcade hardware to run the game at 60 frames per second at a high resolution with no slowdown (by comparison, the original Virtua Fighter ran at 30 frames per second). It introduced the use of texture-mapped 3D characters, and motion capture animation technology. The Saturn version was also well-received for its graphics and gameplay. It became a huge hit in Japan and sold relatively well in other markets, notably the UK.\nThe arena size could be adjusted up to a very small platform or all the way to 82 meters (269 feet). This is the only game in the series—other than Virtua Fighter Remix—that could have such size adjustments. The physical energy meter could also be adjusted to infinity, giving the player the advantage when beating opponents or practicing moves against the computer player. Adjusting the arena to a smaller size and giving the characters infinite health could lead to mock sumo matches, wherein victory is achieved by knocking the other player's character out of the ring.", "publisher": "SEGA", "developer": "SEGA", "releaseDate": 19951030, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Virtua Fighter BLES00029.jpg"], "score": 3.64}, {"name": "Virtua Tennis 3 BLUS30021", "filename": "Virtua Tennis 3 BLUS30021.iso", "size": "4.47 GiB", "date": "20240718", "iconUrl": "covers/Virtua Tennis 3 BLUS30021.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Virtua Tennis 3 BLUS30021.jpg", "matchedName": "Virtua Tennis 3", "category": ["Sports"], "description": "Based on the spectacularly successful arcade version, Virtua Tennis 3 adds dazzling power to the renowned series for next-gen consoles while retaining that easy to play, difficult to master gameplay loved around the world.", "publisher": "SEGA", "developer": "Sumo Digital", "releaseDate": 20070308, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Virtua Tennis 3 BLUS30021.jpg"], "score": 80}, {"name": "Virtua Tennis 4 BLES00912", "filename": "Virtua Tennis 4 BLES00912.iso", "size": "3.06 GiB", "date": "20240718", "iconUrl": "covers/Virtua Tennis 4 BLES00912.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Virtua Tennis 4 BLES00912.jpg", "matchedName": "Virtua Tennis 4", "category": ["Sports"], "description": "The world’s top stars return – The top players in the world return, joined by some of the most exciting up-and-coming contenders.

It is up to you to decide which faction to support in an almighty conflict amongst the region’s three powers, and so direct the course of Japan’s history.\nWill you aid the shogunate pro-government in their attempts to keep the peace and establish cordial relations with the foreign contingent?\nWill you help the nationalistic isolationists in their attempts to exile this potential threat to the Japanese way of life?\nOr will you ally with the foreigners directed by the British Navy in their attempts to establish silk trade and foster cultural exchange?\nWho will you support? Who will you betray?  Become the ultimate bastion of virtue or the ultimate disgrace to humanity, and do it however you'd like.  The choice is entirely your own...\nCome join the denizens of this conflicted harbour and enjoy all the series staples you've come to expect from Way of the Samurai:\n•\tBranching storylines with multiple endings\n•\tDynamic combat system\n•\tVast array of melee and gunpowder weaponry\n•\tExtensive character customization\n•\tKey event decision making\n•\tSword collecting\n•\tOriginal Japanese voiceover with English subtitles\nThis PC conversion also features a number of improvements over the original, ensuring that PC gamers receive the best gaming experience possible:\n•\tImproved user interface with both gamepad and keyboard support\n•\t8 stunning Steam Trading Cards to collect!\n•\tSteam Achievements\n•\tCloud Saves\nWhat the reviewers had to say about the PS3 version\n“Ridiculously over-the-top Japanese historical setting combined with samurai badassery and an open-world, Choose Your Own Adventure–style interface.” - EGM\n“I can recommend this game to anyone who is a diehard fan of samurais and enjoys a good combat system wrapped around a unique way of telling a story.” - Darkstation\n“...a unique, rewarding experience that to date, can't be found anywhere else.” – Destructoid", "publisher": "Ghostlight", "developer": "XSEED Games", "releaseDate": 20110303, "screenshots": ["screenshots/Way of the Samurai 4 BLES01682.jpg"], "score": 72}, {"name": "We Dare BLES01215", "filename": "We Dare BLES01215.iso", "size": "1.03 GiB", "date": "20240718", "iconUrl": "covers/We Dare BLES01215.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/We Dare BLES01215.jpg", "matchedName": "We Dare", "category": ["Arcade"], "publisher": "Ubisoft Entertainment", "developer": "Ubisoft Shanghai", "releaseDate": 20110311, "screenshots": ["screenshots/We Dare BLES01215.jpg"]}, {"name": "Wet BLES00707", "filename": "Wet BLES00707.iso", "size": "5.48 GiB", "date": "20240718", "iconUrl": "covers/Wet BLES00707.jpg", "bannerUrl": "backgrounds/Wet BLES00707.jpg", "matchedName": "WET", "category": ["Shooter", "Action", "Casual", "Strategy", "Indie"], "description": "A highly-stylized third person shooter than seamlessly blends gun play, swords skills and over-the-top acrobatics to create the ultimate interactive action experience.

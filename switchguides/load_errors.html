<body>
    <h1>Fixing Game Load Errors</h1>
    <p>There are several potential causes for games not loading on your Nintendo Switch, especially in jailbreak mode. Below is a comprehensive guide to troubleshooting and resolving these issues.</p>

    <h2>1. Missing or Incomplete Game Data</h2>
    <p>Games typically consist of four key components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Base Game Data:</strong> This is the core data required to run the game.</li>
        <li><strong>Update Game Data:</strong> Updates that enhance or fix the game.</li>
        <li><strong>DLC Data:</strong> Optional downloadable content.</li>
        <li><strong>Ticket Data:</strong> Authorization data tied to game files.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All games will require the <strong>Base Game Data</strong> to function properly. If a game is not loading, it could be due to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Corrupt data from an incomplete installation.</li>
        <li>Missing tickets for the base game or updates.</li>
        <li>Only the update file being installed without the base game.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ensure that the base game and any additional files (updates, DLCs, tickets) are properly installed and verified.</p>

    <h2>2. Save Data Mismatch</h2>
    <p>A save data mismatch occurs when the version of the save data is incompatible with the current version of the game. This can happen in the following scenarios:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Updating the game:</strong> When a game is updated (e.g., from version 1.0 to 1.5), the save data is typically converted to match the new version. If this process fails, the game may not load.</li>
        <li><strong>Downgrading the game:</strong> If you delete the update data and revert a game (e.g., from version 2.5 to 1.0), the save data created for version 2.5 will not work with version 1.0.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This issue is common in first-party titles such as <strong>Zelda, Pok√©mon,</strong> and <strong>Animal Crossing</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Potential Fixes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Delete the problematic save data (backup first).</li>
        <li>Roll back the game to the version compatible with the save data.</li>
        <li>As a last resort, purge all related data for the game and use <strong>DBI's tools</strong> to clean up orphaned files. If the problem persists, reformatting the console may be necessary.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Missing Sigpatches</h2>
    <p>In jailbreak (JV) mode, <strong>sigpatches</strong> are essential for installing and running games, including backups. Without these patches, games will fail to load. Ensure your sigpatches are up to date and compatible with your custom firmware version.</p>

    <h2>4. Fake SD Card</h2>
    <p>Using fake SD cards is a major issue and should be avoided at all costs. These cards often fail under load, leading to data corruption or games not loading properly. Always use a genuine, high-quality SD card for your Nintendo Switch.</p>

    <h2>5. Hardware Faults</h2>
    <p>In rare cases, hardware issues such as failing <strong>RAM</strong> or a failing <strong>APU</strong> (Accelerated Processing Unit) can cause games to crash or fail to load. If you suspect hardware faults, consider consulting a professional technician for diagnostics and repair.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>When troubleshooting game load errors, it is important to methodically identify the cause and apply the appropriate solution. Here's a recap of potential causes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Missing or incomplete game data (base game, updates, DLC, or tickets).</li>
        <li>Save data mismatch due to version changes.</li>
        <li>Absence of necessary sigpatches.</li>
        <li>Use of fake or defective SD cards.</li>
        <li>Underlying hardware faults.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If none of these steps resolve the issue, reformatting the console or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.</p>

    <h1>Setting Up Linux or Android on a Working Switch</h1>
    <p>Adding Linux or Android as additional boot options on a jailbroken Nintendo Switch is a great way to expand its functionality. However, there are several important considerations to keep in mind before proceeding.</p>

    <h2>Key Considerations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Version Compatibility:</strong> Not all versions of Android are compatible with every Switch model:
            <ul>
                <li>Android 10/11 works on Erista (v1 unpatched models).</li>
                <li>Android 12 and newer should work on all models, but each version has its quirks.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>SD Card Space:</strong> These extra boot options take up significant space on the SD card. Ensure you have enough storage available.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning Curve:</strong> Linux and Android have their own user interfaces and functionalities, requiring some familiarity to use effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Barebones Preinstallation:</strong> Our preinstallations of Linux and Android are kept barebones to provide a "fresh from factory" experience, allowing you to customize as needed.</li>
    </ul>

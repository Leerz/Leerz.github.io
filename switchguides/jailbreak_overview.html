<h2>What is Jailbreaking?</h2>
<p>Jailbreaking, a term often used with consoles like the Nintendo Switch, refers to modifying the system—either through software, hardware, or both—to remove restrictions set by the company. Normally, Nintendo restricts the Switch to only play games from its official store or approved sources, including physical cartridges. When you jailbreak the console, it allows you to install homebrew apps, run game backups, play games from other regions, and even mod existing games for a customized experience.</p>
<p>Although there are risks, like potentially affecting how the system works, using the right protections and ensuring safe usage can help minimize these issues. When done properly, the benefits, such as unlocking new features, can far outweigh the downsides.</p>
<h2>Why Jailbreak Your Switch?</h2>
<p>Jailbreaking unlocks a range of features, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Installing custom software like emulators and homebrew games.</li>
    <li>Running backups of your games to avoid carrying physical cartridges.</li>
    <li>Using cheats or mods to enhance game functionality.</li>
</ul>

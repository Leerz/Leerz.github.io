    <h1>Upgrading or Changing SD Cards</h1>
    <p>Upgrading or changing the SD card in a jailbroken Nintendo Switch involves specific steps depending on whether you want to migrate your existing data or start fresh. The method you choose will determine the complexity and whether your data is preserved.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Migration</h2>
    <p><strong>Data migration</strong> is the process of transferring all data from your current SD card to a new one. This method is useful when upgrading to a larger or faster SD card, but it requires time and careful attention to ensure no data is lost.</p>
    <p>Key considerations for data migration:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Backup Current Data:</strong> Create a complete backup of your current SD card and verify its integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>Restore to New SD Card:</strong> Copy the backup data to the new SD card. This step can take considerable time, especially with large amounts of data.</li>
        <li><strong>EMUmmc Type:</strong> The type of EMUMMC configuration will affect the complexity:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>RAW Partition Type:</strong> This hidden partition requires more detailed steps during migration to ensure proper setup.</li>
                <li><strong>SDFILE Type:</strong> Easier to migrate but more prone to corruption and a slight performance hit. Many users avoid this type.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here are some professionally made guides to help you with data migration. Watch these to find the content creator you feel most comfortable following:</p>

    <h2>2. Special Considerations for Android or Linux Installations</h2>
    <p>If you plan to install Android or Linux OS on your Switch, this must be done during the partitioning phase of the SD card setup. It cannot be done after the setup is complete. Attempting to add these OSes later will require starting over, so plan accordingly.</p>

    <h2>Final Notes</h2>
    <p>Upgrading or changing your SD card is an essential process for maintaining performance and storage needs. Always ensure you use high-quality SD cards to avoid compatibility or performance issues. If you're unsure about the process or encounter difficulties, consider consulting professional services or following the recommended guides carefully.</p>

    <h1>Installing Games via Tinfoil</h1>
    <p>While our preferred method for game installation is using DBI on a computer due to its speed, reliability, and ease of use, we understand that some users may want to try installing games over Wi-Fi with the Tinfoil application. Below is a guide on how to use Tinfoil for game installation.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Tinfoil</h2>
    <p>Tinfoil is another application available for the Nintendo Switch that allows users to install NSP files directly. However, unlike DBI, Tinfoil requires access to servers in order to function properly. These servers host the game files and allow you to download and install games directly onto your Switch.</p>

    <p><strong>While Tinfoil is a popular choice due to its convenience, it comes with its own set of challenges.</strong> The primary issue is that servers are often offline, slow, or unreliable, which can lead to failed game downloads. This is one of the biggest downsides to using Tinfoil. People like to use Tinfoil because it allows for quick and wireless game installations, but these conveniences often come with the frustration of dealing with server issues.</p>

    <p><strong>Ultimately, nothing beats the PC method.</strong> The PC method remains the most reliable and consistent way to install games. It avoids the limitations that Tinfoil users often face with server availability and download speeds.</p>

    <h3>Adding Servers to Tinfoil</h3>
    <p>Tinfoil relies on servers to fetch game files, and there are some publicly shared servers available through jailbreak groups. You can add these servers into Tinfoil to start installing games. Please note that these servers are not always reliable, and there are no guarantees they will work.</p>
    <p>We recommend lowering your expectations when using free servers, as they can go offline without notice.</p>

    <h2>Common Tinfoil Issues</h2>
    <p>Users may encounter a few common issues with Tinfoil, such as "low memory" errors or difficulties running the app in Applet Mode. Here's a quick breakdown:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>App Mode</strong>: Tinfoil works best in App Mode. To ensure smooth installation of NSP files, highlight a game, press the R button when launching it, and select "App Mode" in the HBMenu. This mode gives Tinfoil higher memory and privileges.</li>
      <li><strong>Applet Mode</strong>: Tinfoil struggles in Applet Mode due to memory limitations. Applet mode means HBMenu is opened using the album button.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Setting Correct Time and Date for Tinfoil</h3>
    <p>Tinfoil requires the correct time and date settings to work properly. Here's how you can sync it using NTP (Network Time Protocol):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Connect your Switch to Wi-Fi.</li>
      <li>Go to Settings and set the timezone to UTC+8.</li>
      <li>Enable "Network Time" to sync with the correct time.</li>
      <li>Open DBI in HBMenu.</li>
      <li>Go to "Tools" and select "NTP Time Sync."</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Your date and time should now be correctly set for Tinfoil to function properly.</p>

    <h2>Using Tinfoil’s Search Function</h2>
    <p>Tinfoil has a search function that lets you search for games directly. However, it is important to remember that this function depends entirely on the servers you have access to. If the server is down or unavailable, you won’t be able to search for or install any games.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer on Tinfoil Servers</h2>
    <p>Tinfoil works by connecting to servers that host game files. Unfortunately, many of these servers are unreliable or have been taken down. The most commonly shared servers are found in jailbreak groups, but again, we cannot guarantee they will be available or functional. While you may find free servers, we recommend you lower your expectations when it comes to their reliability.</p>

    <p>Previously, there was a free server called "Libera" that worked well, but it has since been discontinued. Free servers are often dependent on the person or group running them, and they may go offline without notice.</p>

    <h2>Why We Recommend DBI Instead of Tinfoil</h2>
    <p>While Tinfoil can be used to install games, we highly recommend using DBI when installing games via a computer. DBI is a more reliable and efficient method for installing games on your Nintendo Switch, as it doesn’t rely on external servers. You can download games from websites and install them directly via your PC, which is faster and ensures you have access to the game files you need.</p>

    <p>For users who want a more stable experience with guaranteed results, DBI is the preferred method. Tinfoil is prone to server outages and frequent issues, making it a less reliable option in the long run.</p>

    <h3>Commonly Shared Servers</h3>
    <p>While Tinfoil relies on external servers to install games, these servers are often shared within the community. It’s important to understand that the availability and reliability of these servers can be unpredictable. When they work, they provide a quick and easy way to install games directly to your Switch. However, when they don’t work—or if they are slow or offline—it’s simply part of the process. There's no guarantee that these shared servers will always be accessible or functional.</p>

    <p>Many users find success with these shared servers, especially when they are active and responsive. But when things go wrong, it can be frustrating. You may experience failed downloads or slow speeds. It’s a reminder that, unlike personal servers or dedicated services, shared servers are dependent on the individual or group maintaining them. Some may even disappear entirely or have limited uptime.</p>

    <p><strong>In summary:</strong> Using these servers can be great when it works, but there are no guarantees. Don’t rely on them as your primary method of installation, especially if you're in a hurry or want a consistent experience. For the most reliable results, the PC method remains the best choice.</p>

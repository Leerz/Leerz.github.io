    <h1>Switch Homebrew Extras: Themes, Cheats, Overclocking, and More</h1>
    <p>Explore additional features for your jailbroken Switch, including themes, cheats, overclocking, and 60fps patches. While these can enhance your experience, please be aware of the potential risks involved with improper usage.</p>

    <h2>Themes and Cheats</h2>
    <p>
        Themes and cheats are popular customizations for the Switch, but they come with inherent risks. Improper installation or corruption can lead to system errors, save corruption, or interference with updates.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Themes:</strong> A corrupt or improperly installed theme can prevent your system from functioning correctly.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheats:</strong> Overloading cheats or poorly configured files may cause persistence issues and save corruption.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    <h2>Overclocking with sys-clk</h2>
    <p>
        Overclocking your Switch using sys-clk can improve performance in demanding games, but it comes with significant risks. Overclocking increases power consumption and generates more heat, which can accelerate hardware degradation.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Heat Risks:</strong> Extended overclocking can cause overheating, shortening the lifespan of your console’s internal components.</li>
        <li><strong>Battery Drain:</strong> Overclocking leads to faster battery depletion during portable use.</li>
        <li><strong>System Instability:</strong> Using excessive overclocking settings may result in game crashes or system errors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Refer to this guide to set up overclocking safely:</p>

    <h2>60fps Patches and Cheats</h2>
    <p>
        60fps patches allow certain games to run at higher frame rates, enhancing gameplay smoothness. However, these patches require caution:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Not all games support 60fps patches without issues.</li>
        <li><strong>System Stress:</strong> Forcing games to run at 60fps can stress hardware and increase heat output.</li>
    </ul>
